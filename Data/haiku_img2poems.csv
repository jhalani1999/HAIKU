6863,hark to the ominous sound,how the far-off gales their battle form,and the great sea-swells feel ground,img2poems
6864,one hand is fallen in the sea,the gulf stream drifts it far and free,and in that hand her shining brand gleams from the depths resplendently,img2poems
6865,for panoply and coronal,the mighty immemorial,and everlasting canopy and starry arch and shield of all,img2poems
6866,the dead line and the pent-up pen,the thousands quartered in the fen,the living-deaths of skin and bone that were the goodly shapes of men,img2poems
6867,and his great darkness with the pall,of his dread judgment cover all,till the dead nation rise transformed by truth to triumph over all,img2poems
6868,it's you thet's to decide,ain't your bonds held by fate john,like all the world's beside,img2poems

6883,at last from out the centre fight,spurred up a general's aide,that battery must silenced be,img2poems
6884,when midst the storm of shell,our leader with his sword upraised,beneath our bayonets fell,img2poems
6885,up,up the hill we followed bill,and we captured every gun,img2poems
6886,by heavens,the foemen may track me in blood,for this hole in my breast is outpouring a flood,img2poems
6887,no,no surgeon for me he can give me no aid,the surgeon i want is pickaxe and spade,img2poems
6888,but we stood did we not,like immovable rock,unheeding their balls and repelling their shock,img2poems
6889,did you mind the loud cry,when as turning to fly,our men sprang upon them determined to die,img2poems
6890,great heavens,this bullet-hole gapes like a grave,a curse on the aim of the traitorous knave,img2poems
6891,here morris old fellow get hold of my hand,and wilson my comrade o wasn't it grand,when they came down the hill like a thunder-charged cloud,img2poems
6892,where's wilson my comrade,here stoop down your head,can't you say a short prayer for the dying and dead,img2poems
6893,confusion to traitors,keep hold of my hand,and float the old flag o'er a prosperous land,img2poems
6894,impatient to be where the battle-field calls,every nerve of the charger was strained to full play,with sheridan only ten miles away,img2poems
6895,what was it a dream,am i all alone,in the dreary night and the drizzling rain,img2poems
6896,hist,ah it was only the river's moan,they have left me behind with the mangled slain,img2poems
6897,we met from the battling ranks apart,together our weapons hashed and fell,and mine was sheathed in his quivering heart,img2poems
6898,my brother,would i had died for thee,this burden is more than my soul can bear,img2poems
6899,yea it was noblest for him it was best,there to pass over the river and rest,under the shade of the trees,img2poems
6900,our spirits high with new emprise,ambitious of each exercise,and glowing with a martial thirst,img2poems
6901,athwart the gloom the lightning flashed,and through the cloud some horsemen dashed,and from the heights the thunder pealed,img2poems
6902,a khamsin wind that scorched and singed,like that infernal flame that fringed,the british squares at waterloo,img2poems
6903,virginia cried to tennessee,we two together come what may,shall stand upon these works to-day,img2poems
6904,the tattered standards of the south,were shrivelled at the cannon's mouth,and all her hopes were desolate,img2poems
6905,in vain virginia charged and raged,a tigress in her wrath uncaged,till all the hill was red and wet,img2poems
6906,the brave went down,without disgrace,they leaped to ruin's red embrace,img2poems
6907,they only heard fame's thunders wake,and saw the dazzling sun-burst break,in smiles on glory's bloody face,img2poems
6908,they smote and fell who set the bars,against the progress of the stars,and stayed the march of motherland,img2poems
6909,they smote and stood who held the hope,of nations on that slippery slope,amid the cheers of christendom,img2poems
6910,god lives,he forged the iron will,that clutched and held that trembling hill,img2poems
6911,a mighty mother turns in tears,the pages of her battle years,lamenting all her fallen sons,img2poems
6912,follow me,steady,we'll save the day,img2poems
6913,this was what he seemed to say,and to the light of his glorious eye,the bold brigades thus made reply,img2poems
6914,we'll go forward but you must go back,and they moved not an inch in the perilous track,go to the rear and we'll send them to hell,img2poems
6915,touch it not unfold it never,let it droop there furled forever,for its people's hopes are fled,img2poems
6916,look within,there's an empty stall,where once stood a charger and that is all,img2poems
6917,all,o god,it is all i can speak,img2poems
6918,question me not i am old and weak,his sabre and his saddle hang on the wall,and his horse pined to death i have told you all,img2poems
6919,a cheer and salute for the admiral and here's to the captain bold,and never forget the commodore's debt when the deeds of might are,told,img2poems
6920,now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,our dreadful marches to delightful measures,img2poems
6921,o son of peace,the giant cried thy fate,is sealed at last and love shall yield to hate,img2poems
6922,the unarmed buddha looking with no trace,of fear or anger in the monster's face,in pity said poor fiend even thee i love,img2poems
6923,and the red sparks lit the air,not alone for the blade was the bright steel made,and he fashioned the first ploughshare,img2poems
6924,our stanch good friend is he,and for the ploughshare and the plough,to him our praise shall be,img2poems
6925,where may the grave of that good man be,by the side of a spring on the breast of helvellyn,under the twigs of a young birch-tree,img2poems
6926,but what are the deeds of to-day,in the days of the years we dwell in,that wear our lives away,img2poems
6927,there are three words to speak,we will it and what is the foeman,but the dream-strong wakened and weak,img2poems
6928,the lightnings may flash and the loud thunders rattle,he heeds not he hears not he's free from all pain,he sleeps his last sleep he has fought his last battle,img2poems
6929,alas,they have perished in far hilly regions,and all save the fame of their triumph is gone,img2poems
6930,though nations may combat and war's thunders rattle,no more on the steed wilt thou sweep o'er the plain,thou sleep'st thy last sleep thou hast fought thy last battle,img2poems
6931,nay nay my little girl,quoth he,it was a famous victory,img2poems
6932,watch that they spread where english blood is spilt,lest mixed and sullied with his country's guilt,the soldier's life-stream flow and heaven displease,img2poems
6933,two swords there are: one naked apt to smite,thy blade of war and battle-storied one,rejoices in the sheath and hides from light,img2poems
6934,their shivered swords are red with rust,their haughty banner trailed in dust,is now their martial shroud,img2poems
6935,ah,what a sound will rise how wild and dreary,when the death-angel touches those swift keys,img2poems
6936,the soldiers' guard was brief,whilst right is right and wrong is wrong,ye may not seek relief,img2poems
6937,there is no holier spot of ground,than where defeated valor lies,by mourning beauty crowned,img2poems
6938,waiting the judgment-day,wet with the rain the blue,wet with the rain the gray,img2poems
6939,posting date: december,release date: february,first posted: october,img2poems
6940,mother says i is that a pie,in tones akin to scorning,it is my son quoth she and one full ripe for christmas morning,img2poems
6941,but in the parlor,oh the gems on tables walls and floor,rare first editions etchings and old crockery galore,img2poems
6942,the landlord allowed he was proud,to do the fair thing by that talented crowd,on the rhine generous rhine,img2poems
6943,so a thimble filled he as full as could be,drink long and drink hearty my jolly friends three,of my wine filling wine,img2poems
6944,and when ah when the bonds fall due how passing wroth will wax the,state,from nebo's mount to nazareth will spread the cry repudiate,img2poems
6945,thought the youth and spread his snare,eros chuckling at the blunder,gayly scampered here and there,img2poems
6946,i was young i did not know,whom it was that venus led,that was many years ago,img2poems
6947,o heart of mine,lift up thine eyes,and see who in yon manger lies,img2poems
6948,and the next cavalier sung with make-believe tears,i've loved you,i've loved you these many long years,img2poems
6949,i have looked for the king this many a day,but the years that mock me will not say,why tarrieth he,img2poems
6950,oh is it the king come back to me,proudly and fiercely rideth he,with centuries dight,img2poems
6951,one asketh,tell me myrson tell me true,what's the season pleaseth you,img2poems
6952,why they gave him turbans red,to adorn his hairless head,and knitted jaunty nightcaps to protect him when abed,img2poems
6953,in vain the rest demurred,not a single chiding word,those ladies deigned to tolerate remonstrance was absurd,img2poems
6954,then the other members said,gott im himmel,what a head,img2poems
6955,and this wonderment increased,till the sympathetic priest,inquired of those same ladies: why this fuss about deceased,img2poems
6956,whereupon were they appalled,for as one those women squalled,we doted on deceased for being bald bald bald,img2poems
6957,these and ten thousand other spectres harrow and condemn,the man who's blown in twenty by nine o'clock a,m,img2poems
6958,they were the boys and they the girls who shared my youthful play,they do not answer to my call,my playmates where are they,img2poems
6959,o cottage 'neath the maples have you seen those girls and boys,that but a little while ago made oh,such pleasant noise,img2poems
6960,there's store of wealth,and more of health,in every glass we think,img2poems
6961,and from the bowl,no genial soul,in such an hour can shrink,img2poems
6962,and from the bowl,no genial soul,in such an hour will shrink,img2poems
6963,there's fellowship,in every sip,of friendship's brew we think,img2poems
6964,and when they saw that cunning little mite,they cried in a chorus expressive of delight,what a cute little boy,img2poems
6965,why a cute little boy,a funny little boy,a dear little bow-leg boy,img2poems
6966,now some might suppose that that beautiful bird,performed for her babies the music they heard,for the folk in the little straw parlor don't you,img2poems
6967,she thought silly girl,'t was a beau come to woo,but i guess it was only the cricket don't you,img2poems
6968,'t is there to find the loveliest plates,at such surprisingly low rates,you'd not believe it true,img2poems
6969,and there is one napoleon vase,i'm sure you'd like to know that place,but no i will not tell,img2poems
6970,thy breath that was fragrant anon with rapture of music and loving,it grieveth all things with its sting and the frost of its wailing,displeasure,img2poems
6971,with togas battle axes shields we made a dazzling show,when we were roman soldiers with brutus in st,jo,img2poems
6972,for love of art not lust for gold consumed us years ago,when we were roman soldiers with brutus in st,jo,img2poems
6973,my lips were sealed but that it seems quite proper you should know,that rome was nowhere in it at philippi in st,jo,img2poems
6974,and after all my suffering it were not hard to show,that i got my allopathic dose with brutus at st,jo,img2poems
6975,oh yes i travelled far and fast that night and i can show,the scars of honest wounds i got with brutus in st,jo,img2poems
6976,by which you see that public taste has fallen mighty low,since we fought as roman soldiers with brutus in st,jo,img2poems
6977,he was not dead,i found him there,the pan that i was after,img2poems
6978,it is to hear his voices,in every note and every line,wherein the heart rejoices,img2poems
6979,the wolf was very loath to stay,but oh,he could not get away,img2poems
6980,darned if we know but all the same,happy as larks are we,and happier still we're going to be,img2poems
6981,said lyman,and frederick,and jim,img2poems
6982,so it was peter,all day calling reminding and chiding,peter neglected his work therefore that nagging at peter,img2poems
6983,nor is it stated or guessed what was the trend of those volumes,what thing soever it was done with a pen and a pencil,wrought with a brain not a hoe surely 't was hostile to farming,img2poems
6984,fudge on all readin,they quoth or that's what's the ruin of,peter,img2poems
6985,peter derided these things held in such faith by the farmer,scouted at magic and charms hooted at jonahs and hoodoos,thinking and reading of books must have unsettled his reason,img2poems
6986,surely enough he went out into the damp of the morning,into the smudge that the witch spread over woodland and meadow,into the fleecy gray pall brooding on hillside and valley,img2poems
6987,laughing and scoffing he strode into that hideous vapor,just as he said he would do just as he bantered and threatened,ere they could fasten the door peter had done gone and done it,img2poems
6988,wasting his time over books you see had unsettled his reason,soddened his callow young brain with semi-pubescent paresis,and his neglect of his chores hastened this evil condition,img2poems
6989,this is the legend of old told in the tum-titty meter,which the great poets prefer being less labor than rhyming,nor have i further to say for the sad story is ended,img2poems
6990,of deep humiliation for the sullen hired-girl,of grief for mother hating to see things wasted so,and of fortune for that little boy who pined to taste that dough,img2poems
6991,it looked so sweet and yellow sure to taste it were no sin,but oh,how sister scolded if he stuck his finger in,img2poems
6992,but oh,how should i hail the death,that brings that vinous grace to me,img2poems
6993,but pretty girls and nice young men,observe a proper silence when,i chose to sing my lyrics to 'em,img2poems
6994,this man loves farming that man law,while this one follows pathways martial,what moots it whither mortals turn,img2poems
6995,so now good-by,to drugs say i,good-by thou phantom sorrow,img2poems
6996,so speak the three as there they lay,when lo,the white stag sped that way,img2poems
6997,on either margin our songs all done,we move apart while she singeth ever,taking the course of the stooping sun,img2poems
6998,false false a random charge a blame undue,wrest not fair reasoning to a crooked end,false false as you are true,img2poems
6999,be pale afar since still to me you shine,and must while nature's eldest law shall hold,ah there's the thought which makes his random line,img2poems
7000,take courage quoth he and respect the mind,your maker gave for good your fate fulfil,the fate round many hearts your own to wind,img2poems
7001,false path,it cost me priceless years of life,my well-beloved friend,img2poems
7002,o shame,they said such music is not meet,go up like ganymede,img2poems
7003,alas,though ne'er for me those eagle wings,stooped from their eyry proud,img2poems
7004,but strain to reach it ay with wrestlings stout,and hopes that even in the dark will grow,and ploddings wary and slow,img2poems
7005,and can i see this light,it may be so,but see it thus and thus my fathers said,img2poems
7006,if god indeed kept secret couldst thou know,or follow up the mighty artisan,unless he willed it so,img2poems
7007,that which i know and that which i divine,alas,have left thee out,img2poems
7008,i have aspired to know the might of god,as if the story of his love was furled,nor sacred foot the grasses e'er had trod,img2poems
7009,o man with eyes majestic after death,whose feet have toiled along our pathways rough,whose lips drawn human breath,img2poems
7010,when i looked i dared not sigh: in the light of god's splendor,with his daily blue and gold who am i,what am i,img2poems
7011,on that sultry august eve trouble had made me meek,i was tired of my sorrow o so faint for it was double,in the weight of its oppression that i could not speak,img2poems
7012,with that he spread his white wings and swept across the water,lit upon the hooded head and it and all went down,and they laughed as they went under and i woke the old man's daughter,img2poems
7013,o to be at least a cloud that near thee i might flow,solemnly approach the mountain weep away my being o'er thee,and veil thy breast with icicles and thy brow with snow,img2poems
7014,m,i'm hearty lass but warm the weather's warm,i think 'tis mostly warm on market days,img2poems
7015,m,all but this pat that i put by for george,he always loved my butter,img2poems
7016,c,but i want one to play with o i want,a little yellow duck to take to bed,img2poems
7017,f,now granny if you'll hold the babe awhile,'tis time i took up willie to his crib,img2poems
7018,george,well mother 'tis a fortnight now or more,since i set eyes on you,img2poems
7019,g,were not proud of them,eh mother,img2poems
7020,m,i set store by mine 'tis true,but then i had good cause,img2poems
7021,f,no he got his voice from you,do use it george and send the child to sleep,img2poems
7022,g,ay of the purple grapes and crimson leaves,but mother put your shawl and bonnet off,img2poems
7023,and frances lass i brought some cresses in,just wash them toast the bacon break some eggs,and let's to supper shortly,img2poems
7024,oft have i wooed sweet lettice white,by daylight and by candlelight,when we two were apart,img2poems
7025,some better day come on apace,and let me tell her face to face,maiden thou hast my heart,img2poems
7026,how gently rock yon poplars high,against the reach of primrose sky,with heaven's pale candles stored,img2poems
7027,she sees them all sweet lettice white,i'll e'en go sit again to-night,beside her ironing-board,img2poems
7028,turn back the cradle-quilt and lay him in,and mother will you please to draw your chair,the supper's ready,img2poems
7029,yet had i but the past she cries,and it was lost i would arise,and comfort me some other wise,img2poems
7030,we had a message long ago,that like a river peace should flow,and eden bloom again below,img2poems
7031,that was the last hill of the chain,and fair below i saw the plain,that seemed cold cheer to reprimand,img2poems
7032,half-drowned in sleepy peace it lay,as satiate with the boundless play,of sunshine in its green array,img2poems
7033,i looked my thought would make its way,fair is your child of face and limb,the round blue eyes full sweetly shine,img2poems
7034,a twelvemonths' child was at her side,'whose infant may that be,' i cried,img2poems
7035,she rose amazed but cursed me too,she could not hold such luck for true,but gave him soon with small ado,img2poems
7036,master good e'en to ye,a woodman said,who the low hedge was trimming with his shears,img2poems
7037,in sooth a lyre,and as the soft air played,those branches stirred but did not disunite,img2poems
7038,light it old sun wet it thou common dew,that 'neath men's feet its image still may be,while yet it waves above them living lyre like thee,img2poems
7039,only a passing mist the heaven o'ershrouds,it breaks it parts it drifts like scattered spars,what lies behind it but the nightly stars,img2poems
7040,gone,said the poet and about to be,forgotten: o how sad a fate is hers,img2poems
7041,ah,turret clock  i would thy hand,were hid behind yon towering maple-trees,img2poems
7042,and had he friends,one friend perhaps said he,but for the rest i pray you let it be,img2poems
7043,i will not speak i will not speak to thee,my star,and soon to be my lost lost star,img2poems
7044,but shortly as there comes to most of us,there came to him the need to quit his home,to tell you why were simply hazardous,img2poems
7045,peace peace,he cried i lost thee but in truth,there are worse losses than the loss of youth,img2poems
7046,adieu,the poet said my vanished star,thy duty and thy happiness were one,img2poems
7047,although he was her friend: but still that day,where elm and hornbeam spread a towering dome,she crossed the dells to her ancestral home,img2poems
7048,love cannot cool the burning austral sand,nor show the secret waters that lie hid,in arid valleys of that desert land,img2poems
7049,silent they rest in solemn salvatory,sealed from the moth and the owl and the flitter-mouse,each with his name on his brow,img2poems
7050,'all the kings of the nations lie in glory,every one in his own house,then why not thou,img2poems
7051,that i bring thee guard it long,hide the light from buried eyes,hide it lest the dead arise,img2poems
7052,no more need,o mad mistake,with repentance in its wake,img2poems
7053,what change has made the pastures sweet,and reached the daisies at my feet,and cloud that wears a golden hem,img2poems
7054,this lovely world the hills the sward,they all look fresh as if our lord,but yesterday had finished them,img2poems
7055,and here's the field with light aglow,how fresh its boundary lime-trees show,and how its wet leaves trembling shine,img2poems
7056,between their trunks come through to me,the morning sparkles of the sea,below the level browsing line,img2poems
7057,i see the pool more clear by half,than pools where other waters laugh,up at the breasts of coot and rail,img2poems
7058,there as she passed it on her way,i saw reflected yesterday,a maiden with a milking-pail,img2poems
7059,but high she held her comely head,i cannot heed it now she said,for carrying of the milking-pail,img2poems
7060,from the clear pool her face had fled,it rested on my heart instead,reflected when the maid was gone,img2poems
7061,with happy youth and work content,so sweet and stately on she went,right careless of the untold tale,img2poems
7062,each step she took i loved her more,and followed to her dairy door,the maiden with the milking-pail,img2poems
7063,fair shine the blue that o'er her spreads,green be the pastures where she treads,the maiden with the milking-pail,img2poems
7064,and let alighting jackdaws fleet,adown it open-winged and pass,till they could touch with outstretched feet,img2poems
7065,she had not feared as i divine,because she had not hoped,alas,img2poems
7066,the sorrow of it,for that sign,came but to pass,img2poems
7067,red rocks that under waters show,blue reaches and a sailing skiff,were spread below,img2poems
7068,ah,why to that which needs it not,methought should costly things be given,img2poems
7069,sure home is best,' the son replied,'i have no home,img2poems
7070,'the perfect face and shed on it,a charm half feeling half surprise,and brim with dreams the exquisite,img2poems
7071,and o for once let me complain,i must forego life's better part,man's dearer gain,img2poems
7072,'robbed robbed of life's illusions sweet,and passion fainting at her feet,to wake no more,img2poems
7073,i would for all my fealty,that i could be as much to you,as you to me,img2poems
7074,how he had said that he would fain,that life would at a stand remain,eternally,img2poems
7075,the well-contented heart be fed,ever as then and all the world,when sails were furled,img2poems
7076,then closer at her side reclined,the bold brown woman from afar,comes to me blind,img2poems
7077,it swept with thunderous noises loud,shaped like a curling snow-white cloud,or like a demon in a shroud,img2poems
7078,then bankes came downe with ruin and rout,then beaten foam flew round about,then all the mighty floods were out,img2poems
7079,thou didst thou didst my daughter deare,the waters laid thee at his doore,ere yet the early dawn was clear,img2poems
7080,thy pretty bairns in fast embrace,the lifted sun shone on thy face,downe drifted to thy dwelling-place,img2poems
7081,that flow strewed wrecks about the grass,that ebbe swept out the flocks to sea,a fatal ebbe and flow alas,img2poems
7082,lift,o lift thou lowering sky,an thou wilt thy gloom forego,img2poems
7083,lift,o lift thou lowering sky,an thou canst thy blue regain,img2poems
7084,m,no: e'en my solitude is not mine now,and if i be alone is ofttimes doubt,img2poems
7085,man dwells apart though not alone,he walks among his peers unread,the best of thoughts which he hath known,img2poems
7086,i wait for my story the birds cannot sing it,not one as he sits on the tree,the bells cannot ring it but long years o bring it,img2poems
7087,let the star-clusters glow,let the sweet waters flow,and cross quickly to me,img2poems
7088,ah my sailor make haste,for the time runs to waste,and my love lieth deep,img2poems
7089,heigh ho,daisies and buttercups,fair yellow daffodils stately and tall,img2poems
7090,o that an echo might wake,and waft one note of thy psalm to me,ere my heart-strings break,img2poems
7091,while swam the unshed tear,her prattlers little heeding,would murmur this bird with its carol clear,img2poems
7092,when the red clay was kneaden,and god made adam our father dear,sang to him thus in eden,img2poems
7093,ah,surely methought by these shouts upraised,some travellers are benighted,img2poems
7094,let the child from its rest be taken,for the captain doth weary for babe and for bride,waken madam waken,img2poems
7095,the daffodils were fair to see,they nodded lightly on the lea,persephone persephone,img2poems
7096,drawn nigh she deemed it fairer still,and stooped to gather by the rill,the daffodil the daffodil,img2poems
7097,o light light light,she cries farewell,the coal-black horses wait for me,img2poems
7098,demeter seeks her far and wide,and gloomy-browed doth ceaseless roam,from many a morn till eventide,img2poems
7099,my life immortal though it be,is nought she cries for want of thee,persephone persephone,img2poems
7100,fade fade and droop o lilied lea,where thou dear heart wert reft from me,persephone persephone,img2poems
7101,or seated on the elysian hill,she dreams of earthly daylight still,and murmurs of the daffodil,img2poems
7102,the tender corn upon the lea,droops in her goddess gloom when she,cries for her lost persephone,img2poems
7103,arise and set the maiden free,why should the world such sorrow dree,by reason of persephone,img2poems
7104,the gates of hades set her free,she will return full soon saith he,my wife my wife persephone,img2poems
7105,her lips reply without her will,as one addressed who slumbereth still,the daffodil the daffodil,img2poems
7106,calm queen of hades art thou she,who stepped so lightly on the lea,persephone persephone,img2poems
7107,come over come home,through the salt sea foam,my sailor my sailor boy,img2poems
7108,yet come to me home,through the salt sea foam,for the greek must ask elsewhere,img2poems
7109,many lands they look to me,one of these might be wanting a prince as well,but that's as hereafter may be,img2poems
7110,she raised her white head,and laughed and she said,that's as hereafter may be,img2poems
7111,ay ay sir,quoth the fisherman,have done,img2poems
7112,he cried and then i rolled the rubbish out,more loudly than the meaning warranted,to air my lungs i thought not on the words,img2poems
7113,then said the fisherman who missed the point,so mike rolls out the psalm you'll hear him sir,please god you live till sunday,img2poems
7114,even so,and you too fisherman for here they say,you are all church-goers,img2poems
7115,ay sir and when he was a younger man,he went out in the lifeboat very oft,before the 'grace of sunderland' was wrecked,img2poems
7116,we too rose up (the crimson in the sky,flushing our faces) and went sauntering on,and thought to reach our lodging by the cliff,img2poems
7117,and rent with many a crevice where the wind,had laid up drifts of empty eggshells swept,from the bare berths of gulls and guillemots,img2poems
7118,i charge you mothers,by the mother's milk,he drew and by his father god over all,img2poems
7119,see here,it is the night,it is the night,img2poems
7120,i think not fishermen i have not heard,such women curse,god's curse is curse enough,img2poems
7121,it is enough can such an one be here,yea here,o god forgive you fishermen,img2poems
7122,a little while it is a little while,a little while and i will comfort thee,i go away but i will come again,img2poems
7123,god save me i have been a sinful man,and save the lives of them that still can work,for they are good to me ay good to me,img2poems
7124,but she if any neighbors had come in,: if any neighbors had come in,they might have seen her crying on her knees,img2poems
7125,and sobbing 'lost lost lost,' beating her breast,her breast forever pricked with cruel thorns,img2poems
7126,and her tears flow down,down to her lips her lips that kiss the print,of nails and love is like to break her heart,img2poems
7127,love and repentance for it still doth work,sore in her soul to think to think that she,even she did pierce the sacred sacred feet,img2poems
7128,and out in darkness with the fisherfolk,we passed and stumbled over mounds of moss,and heard but did not see the passing beck,img2poems
7129,a simple custom this i love it well,a carved betrothal and a pledge of truth,beneath the yew-trees sat our village youth,img2poems
7130,ah sweetest voice,how pensive were its tones,and how regretful its unconscious pause,img2poems
7131,ah would it might be so,i thought and stood,listening entranced among the underwood,img2poems
7132,my daughter my beloved be not you,like those same roses,o bewildering word,img2poems
7133,o woman,thou wert fashioned to beguile,so have all sages said all poets sung,img2poems
7134,she looked again as one that half afraid,would fain be certain of a doubtful thing,or one beseeching do not me upbraid,img2poems
7135,and then she trembled like the fluttering,of timid little birds and silent stood,no smile wherewith to mock my hardihood,img2poems
7136,i thought awhile then slumber came to me,and tangled all my fancy in her maze,and i was drifting on a raft at sea,img2poems
7137,the near all ocean and the far all haze,through the while polished water sharks did glide,and up in heaven i saw no stars to guide,img2poems
7138,the cleft was wide enough to let me through,i clambered out and felt the balmy breeze,and stepped on churchyard grasses wet with dew,img2poems
7139,her dreamy smile was very fair to see,and her two hands were folded to her breast,with somewhat held between them heedfully,img2poems
7140,o fast asleep,and yet methought she knew,and felt my nearness those shut eyelids through,img2poems
7141,o if this be,i said yet speak to me,i blame my very dream for cruelty,img2poems
7142,and sayest thou so,she sighed in murmurs sweet,i have nought else to give thee now mine own,img2poems
7143,when by the churchyard wicket standing still,i cast my eager eyes abroad to know,if change had touched the scenes of long ago,img2poems
7144,my eyes were dazzled with delightful tears,in sooth they were the last i ever shed,for with them fell the cherished dreams of years,img2poems
7145,i looked and on the wall above my head,over her seat there was a tablet placed,with one word only on the marble traced,img2poems
7146,when like shooting-stars the angels,to your couch at nightfall go,are their swift wings heard to rustle,img2poems
7147,of the valley where it grows,but the baby heart receiveth,more than it bestows,img2poems
7148,secure from cold hunger and weather stain,fixed in his right and born to good estate,from common ills set by and separate,img2poems
7149,god,cried the dreaming man right impiously,what have i done that these my sleep affray,img2poems
7150,god,said the phantom i appeal to thee,appoint thou me this man to be my prey,img2poems
7151,god,sighed the kneeling woman frail and old,i pray thee take me for the world is cold,img2poems
7152,her tale,the justice cried,a pauper's tale,img2poems
7153,and he took heart at this so low behest,and let the stoutness of his will prevail,demanding is't for her you break my rest,img2poems
7154,speak,though she kneel throughout the livelong night,and yet shall kneel between thee and the light,img2poems
7155,if thou obey'st a greater tell thy lord,that i have paid her wages,cry to him,img2poems
7156,he has not much against me,none can say,i have not paid her wages day by day,img2poems
7157,then,quoth the shade and he constrained said on,then she reproved curtseyed herself away,img2poems
7158,but yet and yet the dreaded questions came,and didst thou weigh the matter taking thought,upon her sober life and honest fame,img2poems
7159,i gave it he replied with gaze distraught,i gave it fiend the usual care i took,the usual pains i could not nearer look,img2poems
7160,she said she was not guilty,ay 'tis true,she said so but the poor are liars all,img2poems
7161,hear him,the phantom muttered hear this man,o changeless god upon the judgment throne,img2poems
7162,but what,nay verily nor wealth nor weal,from henceforth shall afford thy soul delight,img2poems
7163,what thought she on this woman,on her days,of toil or on the supperless night forlorn,img2poems
7164,with that she opened but for fear she cried,for lo,two angels one on either side,img2poems
7165,call me o call from this world troublesome,and let me see thy face,he answered come,img2poems
7166,i said she was a london woman sir,and a fine scholar but i never said,she knew about the songs,img2poems
7167,tell,there's nought to tell,only they snored o' nights and frighted us,img2poems
7168,ah,there be some hearts i wis,to which nothing comes amiss,img2poems
7169,'cuckoo cuckoo,float anear in upper blue,art thou yet a prophet true,img2poems
7170,cry thou black prophetess,sit up awake,forebode and ban them through the desolate night,img2poems
7171,when i hear the waters fretting,when i see the chestnut letting,all her lovely blossom falter down i think alas the day,img2poems
7172,once with magical sweet singing,blackbirds set the woodland ringing,that awakes no more while april hours wear themselves away,img2poems
7173,what idless graced the twittering things,luxurious paddlings in the spray,and delicate lifting up of wings,img2poems
7174,he knew she did not love him but so long,as rivals were unknown to him he dwelt,at ease and did not find his love a pain,img2poems
7175,she said,i shall not live to see it but she did,little sickly face a wan thin face,img2poems
7176,with that they parted from their boy and lived,longing between his holidays and time,sped he grew on till he had eighteen years,img2poems
7177,i do not care that my one son should sleep,merely for keeping him in breath and wake,only to ride to cover,img2poems
7178,do laddie,quoth she faltering half in tears,are you not happy with us not content,img2poems
7179,but his arms,folding he sat and twisted up his mouth,with comical discomfiture,img2poems
7180,no,do ye laddie,quoth the dame and laughed,img2poems
7181,what then,he dwelt among them as of old,and taught his mouth to smile,img2poems
7182,she cared no whit if laurance went or stayed,but answered when he spoke and dropped her cheek,in her fair hand,img2poems
7183,madam,and muriel lifted up her face,and looked they looked into each other's eyes,img2poems
7184,all's done,you hear it muriel if you can,o sweet forgive me,img2poems
7185,but what was that to muriel though her peace,he would have purchased for her with all prayers,and costly passionate despairing tears,img2poems
7186,ay he was gone,and she whom he had wed,as muriel learned was sick was poor was sad,img2poems
7187,but when that other heard it is the end,his heart was sick and he as by a power,far stronger than himself was driven to her,img2poems
7188,reason rebelled against it but his will,required it of him with a craving strong,as life and passionate though hopeless pain,img2poems
7189,she when she saw his face considered him,full quietly let all excuses pass,not answered and considered yet again,img2poems
7190,remain,she said for there is something to be told,some words that you must hear,img2poems
7191,but were it best to weep for a dead wife,and let the sorrow spend and satisfy,itself with all expression and so end,img2poems
7192,how shall i do the rest,and he who felt,her inmost thought was silent even as she,img2poems
7193,the wife,considering it with deep and strange delight,forgot for once her babe and looked and learned,img2poems
7194,mercy,muriel cried,but laurance does not wish it,img2poems
7195,he knows you love him but he will not speak,no never,some men are such gentlemen,img2poems
7196,the dropping thorn makes white the grass o sweetest lass and sweetest,lass,come out and smell the ricks of hay adown the croft with me o,img2poems
7197,and thou my lass by morning's light wast all in white wast all in,white,and parson stood within the rails a-marrying me and thee o,img2poems
7198,yes and i saw thee start upon thy way,so sure that we should meet,upon our trysting-day,img2poems
7199,and even absence then to me was sweet,because it brought me time to brood,upon thy dearness in the solitude,img2poems
7200,i only saw the stars i could not see,the river and they seemed to lie,as far below as the other stars were high,img2poems
7201,i look on you trembling and think in the dark with my soul,how small is our place 'mid the kingdoms and nations of god,these are greater than we every one,img2poems
7202,and there falls a great fear and a dread cometh over that cries,o my hope,is there any mistake,img2poems
7203,did he speak,did i hear,did i listen aright if he spake,img2poems
7204,did i answer him duly,for surely i now am awake,if never i woke until now,img2poems
7205,for this is a world full of sorrow,keep watch o'er its dust else thy children for aye are undone,for this is a world where we die,img2poems
7206,i have felt it,go on while the world is asleep,golden islands fast moored in god's infinite deep,img2poems
7207,far she sought o'er wood and wold but found not aught to say,mounting lark nor mantling cloud would any counsel render,though sweetly she had carolled upon that morn of may,img2poems
7208,shy she sought the wooer's face and deemed the wooing mended,proper man he was good sooth and one would have his way,so the lass was made a wife and so the song was ended,img2poems
7209,and dove with the white breast,let me alone the dream is my own,and my heart is full of rest,img2poems
7210,my love with the true heart,to think i have come to this your home,and yet we are apart,img2poems
7211,my love,he stood at my right hand,his eyes were grave and sweet,img2poems
7212,till night rose over the bourne,the dove on the mast as we sailed fast,did mourn and mourn and mourn,img2poems
7213,and stirred the dens beneath,to see us eat of death,with all the scoffing heavens toward us bending,img2poems
7214,and the winged armies twain,their awful watch maintain,they mark the earth at rest with her great dead,img2poems
7215,peace,lo he lifts a priestly hand,and blesseth all the sons of men in every land,img2poems
7216,silence,o i had my day,margaret margaret,img2poems
7217,i stoop: within 'tis dark and still,but shadowy paths methinks there be,and lead they far into the hill,img2poems
7218,through foaming gulfs of yeasty spray,to yield it on a grassy hill,at the noon of day,img2poems
7219,and behold,there was music within and a song,and echoes did feed on the sweetness repeating it long,img2poems
7220,i opened the door of my heart,and behold,there was music within and a song,img2poems
7221,o the song,it came and went,went and came,img2poems
7222,i have not learned,half the lore whereto it yearned,half the magic that it meant,img2poems
7223,where's the danger,where's the cold,slippery danger up the steep,img2poems
7224,chirping bird and tumbling spray,light work laughter scent of hay,peace and echo where are they,img2poems
7225,o happy gladys,i rejoice with her,for gladys saw the island,img2poems
7226,but it was said we think it were not well,that little gladys should acquire a taste,for pleasure going about and needless change,img2poems
7227,and how my heart hushed down and shaded lies,just like the sea when low convenient clouds,come over and drink all its sparkles up,img2poems
7228,why gladys is a child she has not skill,to shut herself within her own small cell,and build the door up and to say 'poor me,img2poems
7229,quoth gladys cogitating they were kind,the words that woman spoke,she does not know,img2poems
7230,why did i envy them,that was not good,yet it began with my humility,img2poems
7231,child what art doing here,the woman said,what wilt thou of dame isis and her bairn,img2poems
7232,(ay ay we see thee breathing in thy shroud,pretty shroud all frilled and furbelowed,the air is dim with dust of spiced bones,img2poems
7233,but o good lord ' saith he 'when these are sick,i fear me lord this excellent workmanship,of thine is counted for a cumbrance then,img2poems
7234,so gladys set her feet upon the sand,while in the sunset glory died away,the peaks of that blest island,img2poems
7235,we always read when any fable ends,hence we may learn,a moral must be found,img2poems
7236,she moves atween the almond boughs and bends,one thick with bloom to look on it,o love,img2poems
7237,preserve to me my wealth i do not say,for that is wasted away,and much of it was cankered ere it went,img2poems
7238,no but i pray if it be not too late,open to me the gate,that i may find my babe when i am dead,img2poems
7239,hangs thick as a swarm of bees,or a clustering village street,foundationless built on the seas,img2poems
7240,for rain came down in the night,and thunder muttered full oft,but now the azure is bright,img2poems
7241,many times since we have met,for i hold the years in my heart,and all that was is yet,img2poems
7242,beautiful eyes and shall i see no more,the living thought when it would leap from them,and play in all its sweetness 'neath their lids,img2poems
7243,_quoth the cedar to the reeds and rushes,water-grass you know not what i do,know not of my storms nor of my hushes,img2poems
7244,breathe o wind and set our answer free,for we have no voice of you forsaken,for the cedar-tree,img2poems
7245,the lovely ladies flocked within,and still would each one say,good mercer be the ships come up,img2poems
7246,and they flocked to the shore amain,all over the hoe that livelong night,many stood out in the rain,img2poems
7247,now farther on in womanhood,she gently stands where once she stood,and sings from out her deeper heart,img2poems
7248,i will not think upon it,yet she was,o she was dear my dutiful dear child,img2poems
7249,one soweth nay but i will tell this out,the first fyte was the best i call it such,for now as some old song men think on it,img2poems
7250,i dwell where england narrows running north,and while our hay was cut came rumours up,humming and swarming round our heads like bees,img2poems
7251,let be ' and pushing past 'beshrew thy heart,bargain,nay,img2poems
7252,beside them scorched smoke-blackened weary leaned,men that had fed them dropped their tired arms,and dozed,img2poems
7253,then to our hearts valour crept home again,alva who did convert from our old faith,with many a black deed done for a white cause,img2poems
7254,o such a sight,o such a sight mine eyes,never shall you see more,img2poems
7255,all grey the sea and ghostly grey the ships,and after in the offing rocked our fleet,having lain quiet in the summer dark,img2poems
7256,let spain within a pike's length hear them bleat,delivering of their pretty talk in a tongue,whose meaning cries not for interpreter,img2poems
7257,and while i spoke their topsails friend and foe,glittered and there was noise of guns pale smoke,lagged after curdling on the sun-fleck'd main,img2poems
7258,who ever saw weakling white butterflies,chasing of gallant swans and charging them,and spitting at them long red streaks of flame,img2poems
7259,'two of their caravels we sank and one,took,ere she could catch the wind when she rode free,img2poems
7260,some did tow,others that we had plagued disabled rent,many full heavily damaged made their berths,img2poems
7261,blood-red pillars of reek,they looked on that vast host and troubled it,as on th' egyptian host one looked of old,img2poems
7262,it failed and in regard of that same want,they thought it not convenient to pursue,their vessels farther,img2poems
7263,all being ready speed i home and lo,my rosamund that by the spaniard sat,upon a cushion'd settle book in hand,img2poems
7264,she held,her psalter and he his and slowly read,till he would stop her at the needed word,img2poems
7265,thy wife ' and there he stopped her and he took,and kissed her hand and show'd in 's own a ring,taking no heed of me no heed at all,img2poems
7266,and slowly slowly she betook herself,down the long hall in lowly wise she went,and made her moans,img2poems
7267,but when my girl was gone,i stood at fault th' occasion master'd me,belike it master'd him for both felt mute,img2poems
7268,for i bethought me i was yet an host,and he bethought him on the worthiness,of my first deeds,img2poems
7269,i will be brief,the days drag on,my soul forebodes her death my lonely age,img2poems
7270,the pear-trees looked on in their white and blue birds flash'd about,and they too were angry as oliver,were they eleven,img2poems
7271,a pity,a very great pity,one should be eleven,img2poems
7272,i knew about heaven,but this was the country of this,light blossom and piping and flashing of wings not at all,img2poems
7273,'the ways will be long but the days will be long ' quoth the river,'to me a long liver long long,' quoth the river the river,img2poems

7290,laurie laurie lad make not wail,with a wiser lass ye'll sure prevail,for ye sing like a woodland nightingale,img2poems
7291,and there's no sense in it under the sun,for of three that woo i can take but one,so what's to be done what's to be done,img2poems
7292,there's no sense in it under the sun,and,of three that woo i can take but one,img2poems

7303,the mystery of the world whose name is life,all-conquering wends,and works for aye with rest and cold at strife,img2poems
7304,yet such for aye divided from us are,as other galaxies that seem no more,than a little golden millet-seed afar,img2poems
7305,divided swarming down some flat lee shore,then risen while all the air that takes no word,tingles and trembles as with cries not heard,img2poems
7306,though time be as a moon upon the wane,who walk with faith far up the azure lift,oft hear her talk of lights to wax again,img2poems
7307,the woman before her lord,shall glory fling,the rolls aside time raze out triumphs past,img2poems
7308,such as can see,why should they doubt,the childhood of a race,img2poems
7309,i saw,once in that earth primeval once a face,a little face that yet i dream upon,img2poems
7310,and i could walk and went,led by the hand through a long mead at morn,bathed in a ravishing excess of light,img2poems
7311,awhile our feeding hearts all satisfied,took in the blue of one another's eyes,two dimpled creatures rose-lipped innocent,img2poems
7312,'you're sure it was the queen,'of course a crown,was on her and a spangly purple gown,img2poems
7313,here they were beggar children in the street,and the dove said they had the prettiest things,and wore their best frocks every day,img2poems
7314,'o yes and lined with white,like swallow wings so soft so very light,fluttering about,img2poems
7315,oft as in a dream i see full fain,the bell-tower beautiful that i love well,a seemly cluster with her churches twain,img2poems
7316,ay gone,the soft deceptive echoes roll,away and faint into remoteness,img2poems
7317,or thus of old men feigned and then did fear,then straight crowd forth the great ones of the sky,in flashing flame at strife to reach more near,img2poems
7318,wait and desire it life waits not free there,to good to evil thy right perilous,all shall be fair and yet it is not fair,img2poems

7323,'great oaks' methought as i drew near to gaze,'were but of small account when these came down,drawn rough-hewn in to serve the tree-girt town,img2poems
7324,she leaned against the pillar and below,three almost babes her care she watched the while,with downcast lashes and a musing smile,img2poems
7325,her cheeks like winter apples red of hue,her glance aside,to whom her speech to me,img2poems
7326,farewell good dame,lost,oh my lady lost,img2poems
7327,lost lost and lost whenas the cross road flee,up tumbled hills on each for eyes attent,a carriage creepeth,img2poems
7328,thus with myself i spoke,a rough brick floor,made the place homely i would rest me there,img2poems

7338,unhappy love,and i of that great host,unhappy love who cry unhappy most,img2poems
7339,then saw her demon blush vesuvius try,then evil ghosts white from the awful prime,thrust up sharp peaks to tear the tender sky,img2poems
7340,the stroke of noon,the bell-bird,yes and no,img2poems
7341,a footstep near,i turned past likelihood,past hope before me on the bridge she stood,img2poems
7342,on moorish walls yet hung long dust each hand,the keys but not the might to use remain,is there such house in some blest land for me,img2poems
7343,a country conquered oft and long before,of generations aye ordained to win,if mine the power i will unlock the door,img2poems

7371,'tis the whole world whereon they lie,the rocky pastures hung on high,shelve off upon an empty sky,img2poems
7372,sigismund hath ricked the hay,he sitteth at close o' a sultry day,under his mulberry boughs at ease,img2poems
7373,faint as the light of stars and wan,as snow at night when the moon is gone,it is the white-witch risen once more,img2poems
7374,the white-witch that tempted of yore,so utterly doth substance lack,you may breathe her nearer and breathe her back,img2poems

7383,parted in hiding some other in thrall,father and mother mother and father kind,it may be yet ye know not this not all,img2poems
7384,but after pause i felt a hand let down,that rested kindly firmly a man's hand,upon my shoulder there was cheer in it,img2poems
7385,then took a key opened and crying 'delia,delia my sweetheart i am come i am come,i darted forward and he locked us in,img2poems
7386,but for that other while she stood appeased,for cruel parting past locked in mine arms,i had been glad expecting a good end,img2poems
7387,there was a day when to the wilderness,my great forerunner from his thrall sent forth,sad messengers demanding art thou he,img2poems
7388,how could i hold the power and want the will,or want the love,that pang was his and mine,img2poems
7389,one drew i to the opening on it set,my delia kneeled upon its arm laid mine,and prayed to god and prayed of her,img2poems
7390,truly unless my soul i would have bound,with false oaths difficult innumerous strong,way was not left me to get free,img2poems
7391,but now,said she i am happy i have seen the place,where i am going,img2poems
7392,pray you make haste,i know not haste he said,i was not fashioned to be thrall of time,img2poems
7393,the weird pathetic scarlet of day dawning,more kin to death of night than birth of morn,peered o'er yon hill bristling with spires of pine,img2poems
7394,i knew this man for him who spoke with me,letting me see my delia,i looked up,img2poems
7395,am i a fiend,no he was good to me,almost he placed his life in my hand,img2poems
7396,she is no mother of mine she slew my love,what answer,'peace peace thou art hard on me,img2poems
7397,but god is greater than the church,i hope,he shall not for that he loved men lose god,img2poems
7398,i have no vision but where vision fails,faith cheers and truly truly there is need,the god of this world being so unkind,img2poems
7399,i cannot fathom them,there is not time,so quickly men condemned me to this cell,img2poems
7400,and now he knows i would believe e'en so,as pleaseth him an there was time to learn,or certitude of heart but time fails time,img2poems
7401,he knoweth also 't were a piteous thing,not to be sure of my love's welfare not,to see her happy and good in that new home,img2poems
7402,white ashes and a waft of vapour i,to flutter on before the winds,no no,img2poems
7403,and yet for ever ay my flesh shall hiss,and i shall hear 't,dreadful unbearable,img2poems
7404,i have waked long,and cannot hold my thoughts upon th' event,they slip they wander forth,img2poems
7405,you tremble alas and alas you heard bad news from the town,'only one short half hour to tell it,my poor courage fails,img2poems
7406,and the time is come ronald knows nothing your father will go,as the shadow fades from its place will he and be seen no more,'there 'll be time to think to-morrow and after but to-day no,img2poems
7407,now scarlet o look,overcoming the blue both lake and sky,while the waterfalls waver like smoke then leap in and are not,img2poems
7408,ah,here is your ring see i draw it off it must not be mine,put it on love if but for the moment and listen to me,img2poems
7409,you might give your name to my father's child,' 'my father's name,ay,img2poems
7410,i clomb full high the belfry tower,up to yon arrow-slit up and away,i said 'let me look on my heart's fair flower,img2poems
7411,my care she knoweth not no nor the cause,white rose red rose about her hung,and i aloft with the doves and the daws,img2poems
7412,the pity of it,love's a rover,the last word said and all over,img2poems
7413,quoth the brown bee,'in thy white wear,four thou art fair,img2poems
7414,but as for me,i ' quoth the bee,'never am fair,img2poems
7415,the little ones care not,and i fare not,amiss with thee,img2poems
7416,ay thou full fain,in the soft rain,shalt sing again,img2poems
7417,a fair wife making her moan despised forsaken,her good days o'er,seven no more,img2poems
7418,to these,add thick espaliers where the bullfinch came,to strew much budding wealth and was not chid,img2poems
7419,an all-sufficient world,and as it seems an undiscovered world,so very few the folk that come to look,img2poems
7420,and so the world was sweet and it was strange,sweet as a bee-kiss to the crocus flower,surprising fresh direct but ever one,img2poems
7421,whate'er she wanted wanted all,o how,'t was poignant her rich voice not like a bird's,img2poems
7422,could she not dwell content and let them be,that they might take their pleasure in the town,for no she was not poor witness the pence,img2poems
7423,but now,they closed the shops the wild clear voice was still,the beggars moved away where was their home,img2poems
7424,white as white butterflies that each one dons,her face their wide white wings to shade withal,many moon-daisies throng the water-spring,img2poems
7425,while couched in rising barley titlarks call,and bees alit upon their martagons,do hang a-murmuring a-murmuring,img2poems
7426,may be their plaint when we shall meet again,and make our peace with them the sea of life,find flowing full nor ought or lost or vain,img2poems
7427,shall the vague hint whereof all thought is rife,the sweet pathetic guess indeed come true,and things restored reach that great residue,img2poems
7428,to stay my pleading 'take me to church and give me my ring,'you should have spoken before ' he had sighed when i prayed him so,for his heart was sick for himself and me and this bitter thing,img2poems
7429,but spare me the ending,i did not wait to be quite cast away,i left him asleep and the bare sun rising shone red on my gown,img2poems
7430,look back they must and show thee thy fair past,or choosing thy to-day they may but chant,as they behold,img2poems
7431,it may be god's first work is but to breathe,and fill the abysm with drifts of shining air,that slowly slowly curdle into worlds,img2poems
7432,go up go mark the whiteness of the snow thy,faith is not thy saviour not thy god,though faith waste fruitless down a desert old,img2poems
7433,then straightway flashes up athwart the words,and if i be a son i am very far,from my great father's house i am not clean,img2poems
7434,ay he shall come in truth to visit thee,and thou shalt mourn to him unclean unclean,but never more i will to have it so,img2poems
7435,from henceforth thou shalt learn that there is love,to long for pureness to desire a mount,of consecration it were good to scale,img2poems
7436,this that i bear what is it,me no less,it binds i cannot disenslave my soul,img2poems
7437,for even thus it is with them: the day,waxeth to wane anon and a long night,leaves the dark heart unsatisfied with stars,img2poems
7438,my want is god's desire to give he yearns,to add himself to life and so for aye,make it enough,img2poems
7439,hard lines it gives them cold and dirt abhorred,hunger and nakedness in lieu of love,and blows instead of care,img2poems
7440,with that his hand,he laid upon a latch and lifted it,looked in full quietly and entered straight,img2poems
7441,now in that town there was an ancient church,a minster of old days which these had turned,to parish uses: there the curate served,img2poems
7442,and when the verger gave he moved with him,toward the door distraught then shut him out,and locked himself within the church alone,img2poems
7443,my heart is darkened and unclean,ah me,to be a man and yet to tremble so,img2poems
7444,till the strong angels pitiless and stern,but to them loving ever sweep them in,by armsful to the unapproachable fold,img2poems
7445,i would fain,said he have heard some more,and wilt thou go,img2poems
7446,and straight the little child put forth his hand,and touched him,master master hush,img2poems
7447,the curate murmured when he came again,to himself and looked about him,this is strange,img2poems
7448,there lieth at my feet frail white and dead,the sometime beggar,he is happy now,img2poems
7449,there must be something wrong,look to it: let us mend our ways,farewell,img2poems
7450,a thought from his heart doth reach to hers,come down o lady,to me,img2poems
7451,behold him,with the flock he wons,along yon grassy lea,img2poems
7452,oh,well is me she saith when day,draws on to eventide,img2poems
7453,my shepherd lord,i see him not,but he will come again,img2poems
7454,while he slumbered who can answer for what dreams they may have brought,him,when at midnight all was still,img2poems
7455,father,mother,must you leave him on his bed but not to slumber,img2poems
7456,surely no,i will be silent in your soul is no reflection,of the care that burdens mine,img2poems
7457,is it so my little henry,are we set so far asunder,who were wont to be so near,img2poems
7458,be thou near each chastened spirit for its course and conflict nerving,let thy voice say father mother lo,thy treasures live above,img2poems
7459,then by one man's intercession standing clear from their transgression,father mother you shall meet them fairer than they were before,ay for ever evermore,img2poems
7460,let her rapt dreamy smile,the wondering heart beguile,that almost thinks to hear a calm contented sigh,img2poems
7461,what trance-like peace is shed,on her reclining head,and e'en on listless feet what languor of repose,img2poems
7462,hearing of that blest shore,she thinks on earth no more,contented to forego this wintry land,img2poems
7463,she has nor thought nor care,but to rest calmly there,and hold the snowdrops pale that blossom in her hand,img2poems
7464,the young lips seem to say,i have wept much to-day,and felt some bitter pains but they are over now,img2poems
7465,what is the world,it is a waiting place,where men put on their robes for that above,img2poems
7466,what is the new world,'tis a father's face,beholden of his sons the face of love,img2poems
7467,o night of nights,o night,desired of man so long,img2poems
7468,the waits of heaven to hear,oh,what it must have been,img2poems
7469,then wilt thou wipe away our tears,and comfort in th' all-hallow'd spheres,them that weep now,img2poems
7470,calm lie the desert pools in a fair wilderness,wind-shaken moves the reed so moves his voice the soul,sick folk surprised of joy wax when they hear it whole,img2poems
7471,but what,his doom yet eating of that tree,had been immortal life of shame and sin,img2poems
7472,where yet th' immortalizing tree doth grow,he shall there meet us and once more reveal,the fruit of life where crime is not nor woe,img2poems
7473,men say we differ'd they speak amiss,this man and i were neighbors ever,i would have ventured my life for his,img2poems
7474,sheltered and safe under roses blown,'_storm cannot touch me hail nor shower,where all alone i sit all alone,img2poems
7475,misty as dreams the moonbeam lyeth,the lady singeth the lady sigheth,'is there no more no more no more,img2poems
7476,mercy is startled and fain would fly,but e'en as she turns her steps o'ertaking,he pleads with her mercy it is but i,img2poems
7477,thine like thus differs form and presence laid,it is the unseen shade which risen hath pressed,above all heights where feet olympian strayed,img2poems
7478,a cottager leaned whispering by her hives,telling the bees some news as they lit down,and entered one by one their waxen town,img2poems
7479,and they are days when drops a veil,a mist upon the distance past,and while we say to peace all hail,img2poems
7480,dark fell the skies when once belated,sad and sorrow-fated i missed the sun,but wake heart and sing for not in vain i waited,img2poems
7481,leave the garden walls where blow,apple-blossoms pink and low,ordered beds of tulips fine,img2poems
7482,who hath most he yearneth most,sure as seldom heretofore,somewhere of the gracious more,img2poems
7483,for fuel at the ebb yon fair expanse,is strewed with driftwood by the breaking wave,and in the sea is fish for sustenance,img2poems
7484,i will build up the entrance of the cave,and leave therein a window and a door,and here will dwell and leave it nevermore,img2poems
7485,and soothed him long until the storm was spent,and the last thunder peal had died away,and stars were out in all the firmament,img2poems
7486,then did he cease to moan and slumbering lay,while in the welcome silence pure and deep,the care-worn parents sweetly fell asleep,img2poems
7487,once to that cottage door,in happy days of yore,my little love made footprints in the snow,img2poems
7488,she was so glad of spring,she helped the birds to sing,i know she dwells there yet the rest i do not know,img2poems
7489,i think but cannot tell,i think she loved me well,and some dear fancy with my future twined,img2poems
7490,but i shall never know,hope faints and lets it go,that passionate want forbid to speak its mind,img2poems
7491,and that's the best of it all,and when she blushes my heart so yearns,that tears are ready to fall,img2poems
7492,in their cups on yonder lea,cowslips fold the brown bee's diet,so the moss enfoldeth thee,img2poems
7493,youth was a pleasant morning but ah,to think 'tis fled,sae lang lang syne quo' her mother i too was young,img2poems
7494,i'd bear the long hours through,thou should'st forget and my sad breast,the sorrows twain should rue,img2poems
7495,the ring was a world too fine,and would it had sunk in a forty-fathom sea,ere the morn that made it mine,img2poems
7496,reach me life's wine and gold,what is man's best all told,if thou thyself withhold sweet from thy throne,img2poems
7497,o my liege lady,and o my loved lady,and o my heart's lady come reign there alone,img2poems
7498,'tis all gold and snow,save where scarlet waves are hurled,down yon gulf below,img2poems
7499,drop drop from the leaves of lign aloes,o honey-dew,drop from the tree,img2poems
7500,there is busy talk around me all about mine ears it hummeth,but the wooden wharves i look on and a dancing heaving buoy,for 'tis tidetime in the river and she cometh oh she cometh,img2poems
7501,bring her to to ship her lading brig or schooner sloop or lighter,with a pull'e haul'e pull'e haul'e yoy,heave hoy,img2poems
7502,what's the good though i be fair,for thou'lt never see me mair,man johnnie,img2poems
7503,fain would i thy small limbs fold,while the weary hours are told,little babe in cradle cold,img2poems
7504,long watchings leave behind them little trace,and yet how sweetly must the mornings pass,that bring that dreamy calmness to thy face,img2poems
7505,thy cheek is resting on thy hand thine eyes,are like twin violets but half unclosed,and quiet as the deeps in yonder skies,img2poems
7506,never more peacefully in love reposed,a mother's gaze upon her offspring dear,than thine upon the long far-stretching mere,img2poems
7507,it faded and she never saw it more,nor any human eye oh grief,oh woe,img2poems
7508,how could he be so late,and then hope fled,and disappointment darkened into dread,img2poems
7509,he journeyed on and as he neared the gate,he met with one to whom he named the maid,inquiring of her welfare and her state,img2poems
7510,thou also thou,must nobly do thy part,that honor leads thee on which holds back me,img2poems
7511,be not thy gratitude deceived,i know,thou think'st it is thy duty i will go,img2poems
7512,faultless and fair all in the moony light,as one ashamed she looked upon the ground,and her white raiment glistened in his sight,img2poems
7513,one year there was fulfilled of happiness,but o,it went so fast too fast away,img2poems
7514,the flowers sent forth their nightly odors faint,when in the darkness waiting he saw one,to whom he said how fareth my sweet saint,img2poems
7515,who answered she hath borne to you a son,then turning left him and the father said,god rain down blessings on his welcome head,img2poems
7516,woe and alas,the times of sorrow come,and make us doubt if we were ever glad,img2poems
7517,for sir though men be evil yet the deep,they dread and at the last will surely turn,to him and he long-suffering will forgive,img2poems
7518,he saith again: i pray thee woman peace,for thou wilt enter when that day appears,the fateful ship,img2poems
7519,then at the last i cried,'if the unseen be silent i will speak,and certify my meaning to myself,img2poems
7520,did they not spend much gear to gather out,such as i tell of and for matching them,one with another for a thousand years,img2poems
7521,what harm then if there came of it a race,inferior in their wits and in their size,and well content to serve,img2poems
7522,my mother was full old when i was born,and that was in her youth,what think you sir,img2poems
7523,and they are proud against the king of heaven,they hope in course of ages they shall come,to be as strong as he,img2poems
7524,laugh,o my heart,i would the voice were stilled,img2poems
7525,then light and cry to him 'great king the son,of old methuselah thy son hath sent,to fetch the growing maids his children home,img2poems
7526,but will the voice think you forbear to chide,nor that unseen who calleth buffet thee,and drive thee on,img2poems
7527,the giant elephants be cunning folk,they lie in ambush and will draw men on,to follow then will turn and tread them down,img2poems
7528,i must sit joyless in my place bereft,as trees that suddenly have dropped their leaves,and dark as nights that have no moon,img2poems
7529,i know it quoth he and she said again,the elder learning thou wouldst pass hath sent,to fetch thee then he rose and followed her,img2poems
7530,i looked it was a dream let no man say,it was aught else,there so the fit goes by,img2poems
7531,sir and my daughters is it eventide,sooner than that saith old methuselah,let the vulture lay his beak to my green limbs,img2poems
7532,would he could steal from thee one secret more,the secret of thy youth,o envious god,img2poems
7533,we die,the words of old methuselah,and his prophecy are ended,img2poems
7534,cowards,i heard them winnow their great wings,they went to tell him but they came no more,img2poems
7535,'behold  behold,the earth that i made green cries out to me,red with the costly blood of beauteous man,img2poems
7536,thus marked he glowing on the branched moss,those red rare moons and let his serpent eyes,consider them full subtly what be these,img2poems
7537,then egg-like cracked the glowing balls and forth,started black angels trampling hard to free,their fettered feet from out the smoking shell,img2poems
7538,and when he looked,the dragon cried thou newly-fashioned thing,of name unknown thy scorn becomes thee not,img2poems
7539,but the dragon left a-tremble called to him,from the nether kingdom certain of his friends,three whom he trusted councillors accursed,img2poems
7540,or i most miserable hold my life,over the airless bottomless gulf and bide,the buffetings of yonder shoreless sea,img2poems
7541,a spirit rose and spake,whereas in heaven is power is much to fear,for this admired country we have marred,img2poems
7542,what if thy slaves by thy consent should take,and bear thee on their wings above the earth,and suddenly let fall how soon 't were o'er,img2poems
7543,and while the sullen camels moved he spake,to him that led the last there are but two,of these my sons but where doth japhet ride,img2poems
7544,that i have looked to for my solacing,in the bitterness to come,my children dear,img2poems
7545,and is this mine,said he my son,mine own,img2poems
7546,so japhet said,sir i am young but of my mother straight,i will go ask a wife that this may be,img2poems
7547,'tis not the manner of our kin to wed,so young,thou knowest it art thou not ashamed,img2poems
7548,for all did scorn her,nay they cried,o fool,img2poems
7549,o japhet well-beloved,and she rose up,and did restrain herself saying dost thou heed,img2poems
7550,japhet spoke,he said my father's slave and she replied,low drooping her fair head my master's son,img2poems
7551,nay but for mine,get hence,obey my words,img2poems
7552,japhet said o maid,sweet are thy words but what if i return,and all again be as it is to-day,img2poems
7553,though ye shall find it even as i had died,silent for any words i might have said,empty for any space i might have filled,img2poems
7554,then he rose,and put aside the curtains of the tent,to look upon his father's face and lo,img2poems
7555,then came a messenger while japhet sat,mournfully and he said the men of might,are willing let thy master youth appear,img2poems
7556,ye mighty ones,it hath been known to you these many days,how that for piety i am much famed,img2poems
7557,and satan answered nay you,be not wroth,yet true it is and yet not all the truth,img2poems
7558,thereat the great leader laughed for scorn,hold snake,if god be just there shall be reckoning days,img2poems
7559,turn now thy reason to the other side,and speak for that for as to justice snake,we would have none of it,img2poems
7560,should i forbear,that have been patient,i will not forbear,img2poems
7561,'but yet ' saith he,'repent and turn you,wherefore will ye die,img2poems
7562,turn then o turn while yet the enemy,untamed of man fatefully moans afar,for if ye will not turn the doom is near,img2poems
7563,then shall the crested wave make sport and beat,you mighty at your doors,will ye be wroth,img2poems
7564,repent and turn thee from thine evil ways,o son,and no more dare the wrath of love,img2poems
7565,they said a man or false or fanatic,may claim good audience if he fill our ears,with what is strange: and we would hear again,img2poems
7566,then one to japhet said,one called the cedar-tree dost thou too think,to reign upon our lands when we lie drowned,img2poems
7567,and he related to them all his ways,from the beginning: of the voice that called,moreover how the ship of doom was built,img2poems
7568,he then replied,what is thy thought,there is no miracle,img2poems
7569,but i have found another yea good sooth,the damsel will not tarry she will come,with all her slaves by sundown,img2poems
7570,and she said,comfort thy heart and eat: moreover know,how that thy great work even to-day is done,img2poems
7571,for this i make thee free,and now thyself,art loveliest in mine eyes i look and lo,img2poems
7572,with that,she answered let this woman sir find grace,and favor in your sight,img2poems
7573,but yet said he o yet,if there be respite for the terrible,the proud yea such as scorn thee and if not,img2poems
7574,and at his feet,the wives of his two other sons did kneel,and wring their hands,img2poems
7575,o is it come to this,he answered them,the door is shut,img2poems
7576,the quivering butterflies in companies,that slowly crept adown the sandy marge,like living crocus beds,img2poems
7577,special thanks to oliver darmstaedter wiebke schuck and thomas schaich,for their help deciphering the old german font used for the poem,`an frau nannette falk-auerbach,img2poems
7578,a birthday song,to s,g,img2poems
7579,i will make to thee a little confession of faith telling thee,my dearer self in words what i do not say to my not-so-dear-self,except in more modest feeling,img2poems
7580,mrs,lanier's own words as written in the brief annals of his life,furnished me will tell the end,img2poems
7581,this is not the place for an essay on the genius of sidney lanier,it is enough to call attention to some marked points,in his character and work,img2poems
7582,whitman is poetry's butcher,huge raw collops slashed from the rump,of poetry and never mind gristle  is what whitman feeds our souls with,img2poems
7583,as near as i can make it out whitman's argument seems to be that,because a prairie is wide therefore debauchery is admirable,and because the mississippi is long therefore every american is god,img2poems
7584,liberty patriotism and civilization are on their knees,before the men of the south and with clasped hands and straining eyes,are begging them to become christians,img2poems
7585,the boy's percy,being old ballads of war adventure and love,from bishop thomas percy's reliques of ancient english poetry,img2poems
7586,the english novel and the principles of its development,crown vo pp,charles scribner's sons new york,img2poems
7587,tell me sweet burly-bark'd man-bodied tree,that mine arms in the dark are embracing dost know,from what fount are these tears at thy feet which flow,img2poems
7588,my gossip the owl  is it thou,that out of the leaves of the low-hanging bough,as i pass to the beach art stirred,img2poems
7589,oh what if a bound should be laid,to this bow-and-string tension of beauty and silence a-spring,to the bend of beauty the bow or the hold of silence the string,img2poems
7590,in my heart,is a motion made,'tis a motion of dawn like a flicker of shade on shade,img2poems
7591,yet now the dew-drop now the morning gray,shall live their little lucid sober day,ere with the sun their souls exhale away,img2poems
7592,still-eyed and shadow-brow'd,steal off from yon far-drifting crowd,and come and brood upon the marsh with me,img2poems
7593,what the cloud doeth,the lord knoweth,the cloud knoweth not,img2poems
7594,what the artist doeth,the lord knoweth,knoweth the artist not,img2poems
7595,how poor how strange how wrong,to dream he wrote the little song,i made to him with love's unforced design,img2poems
7596,i work in freedom wild,but work as plays a little child,sure of the father self and love alone,img2poems
7597,inward and outward to northward and southward the beach-lines linger and curl,as a silver-wrought garment that clings to and follows,the firm sweet limbs of a girl,img2poems
7598,somehow my soul seems suddenly free,from the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin,by the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of glynn,img2poems
7599,the midmorn empties you of men save me,speak to your lover meadows,none can hear,img2poems
7600,i lie as lies yon placid brandywine,holding the hills and heavens in my heart,for contemplation,img2poems
7601,woods and wet pillows,this was all,this ox,img2poems
7602,from here to where the louder passions dwell,green leagues of hilly separation roll,trade ends where yon far clover ridges swell,img2poems
7603,but oh not the hills of habersham,and oh not the valleys of hall,avail: i am fain for to water the plain,img2poems
7604,with one poor word they tell me all they know,whereat their stupid tongues to tease my pain,do drawl it o'er again and o'er again,img2poems
7605,then down he shot bounced airily along,the sward twitched in a grasshopper made song,midflight perched prinked and to his art again,img2poems
7606,sweet science this large riddle read me plain,how may the death of that dull insect be,the life of yon trim shakespeare on the tree,img2poems
7607,burn golden globes in leafy sky,my orange-planets: crimson i,will shine and shoot among the spheres,img2poems
7608,then he sounded and down came kinsmen and clansmen all,ten blows for ten tine on his back let fall,and reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of thong,img2poems
7609,they follow mad hamish afar up the crag toward the sea,and the lady cries: clansmen run for a fee,yon castle and lands to the two first hands that shall hook him and hold,img2poems
7610,fast hamish back from the brink,and ever she flies up the steep,and the clansmen pant and they sweat and they jostle and strain,img2poems
7611,when the last stroke fell then he moved him a pace down the height,and he held forth the child in the heartaching sight,of the mother and looked all pitiful grave as repenting a wrong,img2poems
7612,e'en when thou strivest there within art's sky,full calm thine image in our love doth lie,a motion glassed in a tranquillity,img2poems
7613,frowning the owl in the oak complained him,sore that the song of the robin restrained him,wrongly of slumber rudely of rest,img2poems
7614,and cannot you walk now,bah,don't hop,img2poems
7615,soul could'st thou bare thy breast,as yon red rose and dare the day,all clean and large and calm with velvet rest,img2poems
7616,to-day the woods are trembling through and through,with shimmering forms that flash before my view,then melt in green as dawn-stars melt in blue,img2poems
7617,i pray with mosses ferns and flowers shy,that hide like gentle nuns from human eye,to lift adoring perfumes to the sky,img2poems
7618,i hear faint bridal-sighs of brown and green,dying to silent hints of kisses keen,as far lights fringe into a pleasant sheen,img2poems
7619,i start at fragmentary whispers blown,from undertalks of leafy souls unknown,vague purports sweet of inarticulate tone,img2poems
7620,thus without theft i reap another's field,thus without tilth i house a wondrous yield,and heap my heart with quintuple crops concealed,img2poems
7621,scorning the slow reward of patient grain,he sowed his heart with hopes of swifter gain,then sat him down and waited for the rain,img2poems
7622,he sailed in borrowed ships of usury,a foolish jason on a treacherous sea,seeking the fleece and finding misery,img2poems
7623,lulled by smooth-rippling loans in idle trance,he lay content that unthrift circumstance,should plough for him the stony field of chance,img2poems
7624,yea gathering crops whose worth no man might tell,he staked his life on games of buy-and-sell,and turned each field into a gambler's hell,img2poems
7625,aye as each year declined,with bitter heart and ever-brooding mind,he mourned his fate unkind,img2poems
7626,then worn and gray and sick with deep unrest,he fled away into the oblivious west,unmourned unblest,img2poems
7627,o trade,o trade,would thou wert dead,img2poems
7628,swinehood hath no remedy,say many men and hasten by,clamping the nose and blinking the eye,img2poems
7629,but who said once in the lordly tone,man shall not live by bread alone,but all that cometh from the throne,img2poems
7630,does business mean `die you  live i,then `trade is trade' but sings a lie,'tis only war grown miserly,img2poems
7631,if business is battle name it so,war-crimes less will shame it so,and widows less will blame it so,img2poems
7632,alas for the poor to have some part,in yon sweet living lands of art,makes problem not for head but heart,img2poems
7633,i am not overbold,i hold,full powers from nature manifold,img2poems
7634,the nymphs cold creatures of man's colder brain,chilled nature's streams till man's warm heart was fain,never to lave its love in them again,img2poems
7635,later a sweet voice `love thy neighbor' said,then first the bounds of neighborhood outspread,beyond all confines of old ethnic dread,img2poems
7636,but oh the poor,the poor,the poor,img2poems
7637,alas when sighs are traders' lies,and heart's-ease eyes and violet eyes,are merchandise,img2poems
7638,ah not in these cold merchantable days,deem men their life an opal gray where plays,the one red sweet of gracious ladies'-praise,img2poems
7639,i'll prove that lie upon his head,or i will die instead,fair lady,img2poems
7640,nor time hath changed his hair to white,nor his dear love to spite,fair lady,img2poems
7641,and then the hautboy played and smiled,and sang like any large-eyed child,cool-hearted and all undefiled,img2poems
7642,yet more i learn while friend,i sit by thee,who sees all time sees all eternity,img2poems
7643,howe'er thou turn'st wrong earth,still love's in sight,for we are taller than the breadth of night,img2poems
7644,time hurry my love to me,haste haste,lov'st not good company,img2poems
7645,oh would that i might divine,thy name beyond the zodiac sign,wherefrom our times-to-come descend,img2poems
7646,he called thee `sometime,change it friend,`now-time' sounds so much more fine,img2poems
7647,to thee,come i a poet hereward haply blown,from out another worldflower lately flown,img2poems
7648,thou canst not measure mistress nature's hair,not one sweet inch: nay if thy sight is sharp,would'st count the strings upon an angel's harp,img2poems
7649,the tears i weep by day and bitter night,opinion,for thy sole salt vintage fall,img2poems
7650,`i love thee well dear love ' quoth she `and yet,would that thy creed with mine completely met,as one not two,img2poems
7651,assassin,thief,opinion 'tis thy work,img2poems
7652,by church by throne by hearth by every good,that's in the town of time i see thee lurk,and e'er some shadow stays where thou hast stood,img2poems
7653,thou hand'st sweet socrates his hemlock sour,thou sav'st barabbas in that hideous hour,and stabb'st the good,img2poems
7654,a pilot god a pilot,for the helm is left awry,and the best sailors in the ship lie there among the dead,img2poems
7655,to heal his heart of long-time pain,one day prince love for to travel was fain,with ministers mind and sense,img2poems
7656,`yea yea sweet prince thyself shalt see,wilt thou but down this slope with me,'tis palpable ' whispered sense,img2poems
7657,at the foot of the hill a living rill,shone and the lilies shone white above,`but now 'twas black 'twas a river this rill,img2poems
7658,`i saw true hell with mine own eye,true hell or light hath told a lie,true verily ' quoth stout sense,img2poems
7659,there while they stood in a green wood,and marvelled still on ill and good,came suddenly minister mind,img2poems
7660,`in the heart of sin doth hell begin,'tis not below 'tis not above,it lieth within it lieth within,img2poems
7661,`fixed: follow me would'st thou but see,he weepeth under yon willow tree,fast chained to his corse ' quoth mind,img2poems
7662,there when they came mind suffered shame,`these be the same and not the same,a-wondering whispered mind,img2poems
7663,lo face by face two spirits pace,where the blissful willow waves above,one saith: `do me a friendly grace,img2poems
7664,`read me two dreams that linger long,dim as returns of old-time song,that flicker about the mind,img2poems
7665,`now strange ' quoth sense and `strange ' quoth mind,`we saw it and yet 'tis hard to find,but we saw it ' quoth sense and mind,img2poems

7670,hey rose just born,twin to a thorn,was't so with you o love and scorn,img2poems
7671,sweet eyes that smiled,now wet and wild,o eye and tear  mother and child,img2poems
7672,well: love and pain,be kinsfolk twain,yet would oh would i could love again,img2poems
7673,if haply thou o desdemona morn,shouldst call along the curving sphere remain,dear night sweet moor nay leave me not in scorn,img2poems
7674,nay if ye three o morn,o spring,o heart,img2poems
7675,should chant grave unisons of grief and love,ye could not mourn with more melodious art,than daily doth yon dim sequestered dove,img2poems
7676,i asked my heart to say,some word whose worth my love's devoir might pay,upon my lady's natal day,img2poems
7677,then said my heart to me,`learn from the rhyme that now shall come to thee,what fits thy love most lovingly,img2poems
7678,this gift that learning shows,for as a rhyme unto its rhyme-twin goes,i send a rose unto a rose,img2poems
7679,in four brief cycles round the punctual sun,has she old learning's latest daughter won,this grace this stature and this fruitful fame,img2poems
7680,one wing was feathered with facts of the uttermost past,and one with the dreams of a prophet and both sailed fast,and met where the sorrowful soul on the earth was cast,img2poems
7681,then that artist began in a lark's low circling to pass,and first he sang at the height of the top of the grass,a song of the herds that are born and die in the mass,img2poems
7682,but god was not angry nor ever confused his tongue,for not out of selfish nor impudent travail was wrung,the song of all men and all things that the all-lover sung,img2poems
7683,yet as `a ghost,' his household cry,`he hath followed a ghost in flight,img2poems
7684,'twixt this and dawn three hours my soul will smite,with prickly seconds or less tolerably,with dull-blade minutes flatwise slapping me,img2poems
7685,yea would i rode these mad contentious brawls,no damage taking from their if and how,nor no result save galloping to my dawn,img2poems
7686,my dawn,my dawn,how if it never break,img2poems
7687,come ye wild weeks since first this canvas drew,out of vexed palos ere the dawn was blue,o'er milky waves about the bows full-creaming,img2poems
7688,i marvel how mine eye ranging the night,from its big circling ever absently,returns thou large low star to fix on thee,img2poems
7689,`maria,' star,no star: a light a light,img2poems
7690,john parker,rub thine eyes and yawn,but one o'clock and yet 'tis dawn,img2poems
7691,`lay down your arms damned rebels,' cry,the men in red full haughtily,img2poems
7692,they sit in the reverend hall: `shall we declare,floats round about the anxious-quivering air,'twixt narrow schuylkill and broad delaware,img2poems
7693,now fall the chill reactionary snows,of man's defect and every wind that blows,keeps back the spring of freedom's perfect rose,img2poems
7694,now naked feet with crimson fleck the ways,and heaven is stained with flags that mutinies raise,and arnold-spotted move the creeping days,img2poems
7695,burns the land with redder flame,north in line and south in line,yell the charge and spring the mine,img2poems
7696,heartstrong south would have his way,headstrong north hath said him nay,o strong heart strong brain beware,img2poems
7697,`blow herald blow,' there entered heart,a youth in crimson and gold,img2poems
7698,`blow herald blow,' brain stood apart,steel-armored glittering cold,img2poems
7699,heart and brain,no more be twain,throb and think one flesh again,img2poems
7700,drive them homeward herdsman time,from the meadows of the prime,i will feast my house and rest,img2poems
7701,then called the artist's god from in the sky,this time shall show by dream and mystery,the heart of all his matter to thine eye,img2poems
7702,son study stars by looking down in streams,interpret that which is by that which seems,and tell thy dreams in words which are but dreams,img2poems
7703,and the middle of the day is cold,and the heart of eve beats lax i' the end,as a legend's climax poorly told,img2poems
7704,gray pelican poised where yon broad shallows shine,know'st thou that finny foison all is mine,in the bag below thy beak  yet thine not less,img2poems

8187,his grave,yet if it should be,how can i think grace cried,img2poems

8191,introitus,part i,the divine tragedy,img2poems
8192,pleasant it was when woods were green,and winds were soft and low,to lie amid some sylvan scene,img2poems

8200,death with frosty hand and cold,plucks the old man by the beard,sorely sorely,img2poems
8201,he shall so hear the solemn hymn that death,has lifted up for all that he shall go,to his long resting-place without a tear,img2poems
8202,through the gray mist thrust up its shattered lance,and rocking on the cliff was left,the dark pine blasted bare and cleft,img2poems
8203,ye voices that arose,after the evening's close,and whispered to my restless heart repose,img2poems
8204,go breathe it in the ear,of all who doubt and fear,and say to them be of good cheer,img2poems
8205,ye sounds so low and calm,that in the groves of balm,seemed to me like an angel's psalm,img2poems
8206,go mingle yet once more,with the perpetual roar,of the pine forest dark and hoar,img2poems
8207,tongues of the dead not lost,but speaking from deaths frost,like fiery tongues at pentecost,img2poems
8208,glimmer as funeral lamps,amid the chills and damps,of the vast plain where death encamps,img2poems
8209,my deeds though manifold,no skald in song has told,no saga taught thee,img2poems
8210,o father,i hear the church-bells ring,o say what may it be,img2poems
8211,o father,i hear the sound of guns,o say what may it be,img2poems

8214,many a lesson deep and long,thou hast been a generous giver,i can give thee but a song,img2poems
8215,how like quivering flames they start,when i fan the living embers,on the hearth-stone of my heart,img2poems
8216,that my spirit leans to thee,thou hast been a generous giver,take this idle song from me,img2poems
8217,but still above the noisy crowd,the beggar's cry is shrill and loud,until they say he calleth thee,img2poems
8218,ye that have eyes yet cannot see,in darkness and in misery,recall those mighty voices three,img2poems
8219,the battle of our life is brief,the alarm the struggle the relief,then sleep we side by side,img2poems
8220,thou whose locks outshine the sun,golden tresses wreathed in one,as the braided streamlets run,img2poems
8221,standing with reluctant feet,where the brook and river meet,womanhood and childhood fleet,img2poems
8222,gazing with a timid glance,on the brooklet's swift advance,on the river's broad expanse,img2poems
8223,deep and still that gliding stream,beautiful to thee must seem,as the river of a dream,img2poems
8224,then why pause with indecision,when bright angels in thy vision,beckon thee to fields elysian,img2poems
8225,seest thou shadows sailing by,as the dove with startled eye,sees the falcon's shadow fly,img2poems
8226,hearest thou voices on the shore,that our ears perceive no more,deafened by the cataract's roar,img2poems
8227,like the swell of some sweet tune,morning rises into noon,may glides onward into june,img2poems
8228,childhood is the bough where slumbered,birds and blossoms many-numbered,age that bough with snows encumbered,img2poems
8229,gather then each flower that grows,when the young heart overflows,to embalm that tent of snows,img2poems
8230,bear a lily in thy hand,gates of brass cannot withstand,one touch of that magic wand,img2poems
8231,bear through sorrow wrong and ruth,in thy heart the dew of youth,on thy lips the smile of truth,img2poems
8232,o that dew like balm shall steal,into wounds that cannot heal,even as sleep our eyes doth seal,img2poems
8233,and that smile like sunshine dart,into many a sunless heart,for a smile of god thou art,img2poems
8234,a tear stood in his bright blue eye,but still he answered with a sigh,excelsior,img2poems

8427,from the pitcher placed between us,how the waters laugh and glisten,in the head of old silenus,img2poems
8428,even as a miser counts his gold,those hours the ancient timepiece told,forever never,img2poems
8429,all are scattered now and fled,some are married some are dead,and when i ask with throbs of pain,img2poems
8430,as in the days long since gone by,the ancient timepiece makes reply,forever never,img2poems
8431,the horologe of eternity,sayeth this incessantly,forever never,img2poems
8432,scattered like dust and leaves when the mighty blasts of october,seize them and whirl them aloft and sprinkle them far o'er the ocean,naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of grand-pre,img2poems
8433,dikes that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant,shut out the turbulent tides but at stated seasons the flood-gates,opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows,img2poems
8434,neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows,but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of their owners,there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance,img2poems
8435,stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters,hearty and hale was he an oak that is covered with snow-flakes,white as the snow were his locks and his cheeks as brown as the oak-leaves,img2poems
8436,but a celestial brightness a more ethereal beauty,shone on her face and encircled her form when after confession,homeward serenely she walked with god's benediction upon her,img2poems
8437,firmly builded with rafters of oak the house of the farmer,stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea and a shady,sycamore grew by the door with a woodbine wreathing around it,img2poems
8438,under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside,built o'er a box for the poor or the blessed image of mary,img2poems
8439,there too the dove-cot stood with its meek and innocent inmates,murmuring ever of love while above in the variant breezes,numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation,img2poems
8440,many a youth as he knelt in the church and opened his missal,fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion,happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment,img2poems
8441,bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey,till the hives overflowed and the indian bunters asserted,cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes,img2poems
8442,such was the advent of autumn,then followed that beautiful season,called by the pious acadian peasants the summer of all-saints,img2poems
8443,peace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless heart of the ocean,was for a moment consoled,all sounds were in harmony blended,img2poems
8444,foremost bearing the bell evangeline's beautiful heifer,proud of her snow-white hide and the ribbon that waved from her collar,quietly paced and slow as if conscious of human affection,img2poems
8445,patiently stood the cows meanwhile and yielded their udders,unto the milkmaid's hand whilst loud and in regular cadence,into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended,img2poems
8446,faces clumsily carved in oak on the back of his arm-chair,laughed in the flickering light and the pewter plates on the dresser,caught and reflected the flame as shields of armies the sunshine,img2poems
8447,fragments of song the old man sang and carols of christmas,such as at home in the olden time his fathers before him,sang in their norman orchards and bright burgundian vineyards,img2poems
8448,silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle,while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe,followed the old man's songs and united the fragments together,img2poems
8449,as in a church when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,footfalls are heard in the aisles or words of the priest at the altar,so in each pause of the song with measured motion the clock clicked,img2poems
8450,then with a smile of content thus answered basil the blacksmith,taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside,benedict bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad,img2poems
8451,not so thinketh the folk in the village said warmly the blacksmith,shaking his head as in doubt then heaving a sigh he continued,louisburg is not forgotten nor beau sejour nor port royal,img2poems
8452,as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lover's,blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered,img2poems
8453,then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser,and what their errand may be i know not better than others,img2poems
8454,god's name,shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith,must we in all things look for the how and the why and the wherefore,img2poems
8455,wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed,while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,till evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner,img2poems
8456,simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothes-press,ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded,linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven,img2poems
8457,soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight,streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden,swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean,img2poems
8458,ah,she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with,naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber,img2poems
8459,yet were her thoughts of him and at times a feeling of sadness,passed o'er her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight,flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment,img2poems
8460,and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass,forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps,as out of abraham's tent young ishmael wandered with hagar,img2poems
8461,every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted,for with this simple people who lived like brothers together,all things were held in common and what one had was another's,img2poems
8462,shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white,hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler,glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers,img2poems
8463,gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle,tous les bourgeois de chartres and le carillon de dunkerque,and anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music,img2poems
8464,merrily merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances,under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows,old folk and young together and children mingled among them,img2poems
8465,silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose,louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the door-way,img2poems
8466,flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted,down with the tyrants of england,we never have sworn them allegiance,img2poems
8467,then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside,joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them,mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed,img2poems
8468,busily plied the freighted boats and in the confusion,wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children,left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties,img2poems
8469,back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles and leaving,inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors,img2poems
8470,onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish,wandered the faithful priest consoling and blessing and cheering,like unto shipwrecked paul on melita's desolate sea-shore,img2poems
8471,vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not,but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering fire-light,img2poems
8472,more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents,faltered and paused on his lips as the feet of a child on a threshold,hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow,img2poems
8473,silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them,moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals,img2poems
8474,then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting,whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred house-tops,started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled,img2poems
8475,loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm-yards,thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle,came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted,img2poems
8476,still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape,reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her,and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses,img2poems
8477,then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking,and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor,leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins,img2poems
8478,many a weary year had passed since the burning of grand-pre,when on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile,img2poems
8479,far asunder on separate coasts the acadians landed,scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast,strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland,img2poems
8480,gabriel lajeunesse,they said yes,we have seen him,img2poems
8481,gabriel lajeunesse,said others o yes,we have seen him,img2poems
8482,are there not other youths as fair as gabriel,others,who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal,img2poems
8483,thereupon the priest her friend and father-confessor,said with a smile o daughter,thy god thus speaketh within thee,img2poems
8484,onward o'er sunken sands through a wilderness sombre with forests,day after day they glided adown the turbulent river,night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders,img2poems
8485,level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river,shaded by china-trees in the midst of luxuriant gardens,stood the houses of planters with negro-cabins and dove-cots,img2poems
8486,they were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer,where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron,sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward,img2poems
8487,they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine,soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,which like a network of steel extended in every direction,img2poems
8488,over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress,met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in mid-air,waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals,img2poems
8489,deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons,home to their roasts in the cedar-trees returning at sunset,or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter,img2poems
8490,lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin,img2poems
8491,dreamlike and indistinct and strange were all things around them,and o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness,strange forebodings of ill unseen and that cannot be compassed,img2poems
8492,then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen,and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure,sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle,img2poems
8493,water-lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations,made by the passing oars and resplendent in beauty the lotus,lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen,img2poems
8494,under the boughs of wachita willows that grew by the margin,safely their boat was moored and scattered about on the greensward,tired with their midnight toil the weary travellers slumbered,img2poems
8495,nearer ever nearer among the numberless islands,darted a light swift boat that sped away o'er the water,urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers,img2poems
8496,after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance,as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden,said with a sigh to the friendly priest o father felician,img2poems
8497,beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruit-trees,under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens,bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest,img2poems
8498,large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported,rose-wreathed vine-encircled a broad and spacious veranda,haunt of the humming-bird and the bee extended around it,img2poems
8499,at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden,stationed the dove-cots were as love's perpetual symbol,scenes of endless wooing and endless contentions of rivals,img2poems
8500,in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway,through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending,img2poems
8501,full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas,hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grapevines,img2poems
8502,thus they ascended the steps and crossing the breezy veranda,entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil,waited his late return and they rested and feasted together,img2poems
8503,all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver,fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors,brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight,img2poems
8504,here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies,here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber,with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses,img2poems
8505,after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests,no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads,burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle,img2poems
8506,nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden,poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions,unto the night as it went its way like a silent carthusian,img2poems
8507,and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the fire-flies,wandered alone and she cried o gabriel,o my beloved,img2poems
8508,ah,how often beneath this oak returning from labor,thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers,img2poems
8509,loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded,like a flute in the woods and anon through the neighboring thickets,farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence,img2poems
8510,patience,whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness,and from the moonlit meadow a sigh responded to-morrow,img2poems
8511,bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden,bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses,with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal,img2poems
8512,farewell,answered the maiden and smiling with basil descended,down to the river's brink where the boatmen already were waiting,img2poems
8513,thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness,swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert,img2poems
8514,down from their jagged deep ravines where the gorge like a gateway,opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon,westward the oregon flows and the walleway and owyhee,img2poems
8515,spreading between these streams are the wondrous beautiful prairies,billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas,img2poems
8516,sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his camp-fire,rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall,when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes,img2poems
8517,and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana,showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them,img2poems
8518,once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered,into the little camp an indian woman whose features,wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow,img2poems
8519,she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people,from the far-off hunting-grounds of the cruel camanches,where her canadian husband a coureur-des-bois had been murdered,img2poems
8520,touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome,gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them,on the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers,img2poems
8521,moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,she in turn related her love and all its disasters,img2poems
8522,silent with wonder and strange surprise evangeline listened,to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her,seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress,img2poems
8523,slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose,lighting the little tent and with a mysterious splendor,touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland,img2poems
8524,filled with the thoughts of love was evangeline's heart but a secret,subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow,img2poems
8525,early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee,said as they journeyed along on the western slope of these mountains,dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission,img2poems
8526,soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness,but on evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow-flakes,fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed,img2poems
8527,then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens,blushed at each blood-red ear for that betokened a lover,but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the corn-field,img2poems
8528,so came the autumn and passed and the winter yet gabriel came not,blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird,sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not,img2poems
8529,when over weary ways by long and perilous marches,she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests,found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin,img2poems
8530,then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead,dawn of another life that broke o'er her earthy horizon,as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning,img2poems
8531,in that delightful land which is washed by the delaware's waters,guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle,stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded,img2poems
8532,there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty,and the streets still re-echo the names of the trees of the forest,as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested,img2poems
8533,so when the fruitless search the disappointed endeavor,ended to recommence no more upon earth uncomplaining,thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps,img2poems
8534,night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated,loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city,high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper,img2poems
8535,day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs,plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market,met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings,img2poems
8536,then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city,presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons,darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn,img2poems
8537,hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever,as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals,that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over,img2poems
8538,motionless senseless dying he lay and his spirit exhausted,seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness,darkness of slumber and death forever sinking and sinking,img2poems
8539,all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow,all the aching of heart the restless unsatisfied longing,all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience,img2poems
8540,only along the shore of the mournful and misty atlantic,linger a few acadian peasants whose fathers from exile,wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom,img2poems
8541,i hear your voices softened by the distance,and pause and turn to listen as each sends,his words of friendship comfort and assistance,img2poems
8542,thanks for each kindly word each silent token,that teaches me when seeming most alone,friends are around us though no word be spoken,img2poems
8543,your gentle voices will flow on forever,when life grows bare and tarnished with decay,as through a leafless landscape flows a river,img2poems
8544,stanch and strong a goodly vessel,that shall laugh at all disaster,and with wave and whirlwind wrestle,img2poems
8545,that silent architect the sun,had hewn and laid them every one,ere the work of man was yet begun,img2poems
8546,beside the master when he spoke,a youth against an anchor leaning,listened to catch his slightest meaning,img2poems
8547,only the long waves as they broke,in ripples on the pebbly beach,interrupted the old man's speech,img2poems
8548,the sun shone on her golden hair,and her cheek was glowing fresh and fair,with the breath of morn and the soft sea air,img2poems
8549,and when the hot long day was o'er,the young man at the master's door,sat with the maiden calm and still,img2poems
8550,therefore he spake and thus said he,like unto ships far off at sea,outward or homeward bound are we,img2poems
8551,ah,what pleasant visions haunt me,as i gaze upon the sea,img2poems
8552,and with your floating bridge the ocean span,be mine to guard this light from all eclipse,be yours to bring man nearer unto man,img2poems
8553,they were indeed too much akin,the drift-wood fire without that burned,the thoughts that burned and glowed within,img2poems
8554,now in this crystal tower,imprisoned by some curious hand at last,it counts the passing hour,img2poems
8555,but not for this their revels,the jovial monks forbore,for they cried fill high the goblet,img2poems
8556,take this lesson to thy heart,that is best which lieth nearest,shape from that thy work of art,img2poems
8557,i heard a voice that cried,balder the beautiful,is dead is dead,img2poems
8558,and through the misty air,passed like the mournful cry,of sunward sailing cranes,img2poems
8559,i saw the pallid corpse,of the dead sun,borne through the northern sky,img2poems
8560,blasts from niffelheim,lifted the sheeted mists,around him as he passed,img2poems
8561,and the voice forever cried,balder the beautiful,is dead is dead,img2poems
8562,and died away,through the dreary night,in accents of despair,img2poems
8563,balder the beautiful,god of the summer sun,fairest of all the gods,img2poems
8564,light from his forehead beamed,runes were upon his tongue,as on the warrior's sword,img2poems
8565,they laid him in his ship,with horse and harness,as on a funeral pyre,img2poems
8566,odin placed,a ring upon his finger,and whispered in his ear,img2poems
8567,but out of the sea of time,rises a new land of song,fairer than the old,img2poems
8568,build it again,o ye bards,fairer than before,img2poems
8569,ye fathers of the new race,feed upon morning dew,sing the new song of love,img2poems
8570,sing no more,o ye bards of the north,of vikings and of jarls,img2poems
8571,of the days of eld,preserve the freedom only,not the deeds of blood,img2poems
8572,leaving us heirs to amplest heritages,of all the best thoughts of the greatest sages,and giving tongues unto the silent dead,img2poems
8573,take them o death,and bear away,whatever thou canst call thine own,img2poems
8574,our little life is but a gust,that bends the branches of thy tree,and trails its blossoms in the dust,img2poems
8575,like the beloved john,to lay his head upon the saviour's breast,and thus to journey on,img2poems
8576,tell us of this nawadaha,i should answer your inquiries,straightway in such words as follow,img2poems
8577,gitche manito the mighty,the great spirit the creator,smiled upon his helpless children,img2poems
8578,thus was slain the mishe-mokwa,he the great bear of the mountains,he the terror of the nations,img2poems
8579,no more work and no more weeping,wahonowin,wahonowin,img2poems
8580,lulled him into slumber singing,ewa-yea,my little owlet,img2poems
8581,saw the rainbow in the heaven,in the eastern sky the rainbow,whispered what is that nokomis,img2poems
8582,sang the robin the opechee,sang the bluebird the owaissa,do not shoot us hiawatha,img2poems
8583,all the village came and feasted,all the guests praised hiawatha,called him strong-heart soan-ge-taha,img2poems
8584,welcome,said he hiawatha,to the kingdom of the west-wind,img2poems
8585,ah kaween,said mudjekeewis,no indeed i will not touch it,img2poems
8586,hold,at length cried mudjekeewis,hold my son my hiawatha,img2poems
8587,i have put you to this trial,but to know and prove your courage,now receive the prize of valor,img2poems
8588,then he smiled and said: to-morrow,is the last day of your conflict,is the last day of your fasting,img2poems
8589,lazy kwasind,said his mother,in my work you never help me,img2poems
8590,in the coldest days of winter,i must break the ice for fishing,with my nets you never help me,img2poems
8591,at the door my nets are hanging,dripping freezing with the water,go and wring them yenadizze,img2poems
8592,of your strong and pliant branches,my canoe to make more steady,make more strong and firm beneath me,img2poems
8593,i will make a necklace of them,make a girdle for my beauty,and two stars to deck her bosom,img2poems
8594,take my bait cried hiawatha,down into the depths beneath him,take my bait o sturgeon nahma,img2poems
8595,you are ugudwash the sun-fish,you are not the fish i wanted,you are not the king of fishes,img2poems
8596,then began the greatest battle,that the sun had ever looked on,that the war-birds ever witnessed,img2poems
8597,still dissuading said nokomis,bring not to my lodge a stranger,from the land of the dacotahs,img2poems
8598,thus it was he won the daughter,of the ancient arrow-maker,in the land of the dacotahs,img2poems
8599,sang the robin the opechee,happy are you laughing water,having such a noble husband,img2poems
8600,barred with streaks of red and yellow,streaks of blue and bright vermilion,shone the face of pau-puk-keewis,img2poems
8601,over it the star of evening,melts and trembles through the purple,hangs suspended in the twilight,img2poems
8602,you shall hear a tale of wonder,hear the story of osseo,son of the evening star osseo,img2poems
8603,and her lovers the rejected,handsome men with belts of wampum,handsome men with paint and feathers,img2poems
8604,changed into a weak old woman,with a staff she tottered onward,wasted wrinkled old and ugly,img2poems
8605,and behold,the earthen kettles,all were changed to bowls of silver,img2poems
8606,'t was no bird he saw before him,'t was a beautiful young woman,with the arrow in her bosom,img2poems
8607,in those days said hiawatha,lo,how all things fade and perish,img2poems
8608,very crafty very cunning,is the creeping spirit of evil,was the meaning of this symbol,img2poems
8609,then the figure seated singing,playing on a drum of magic,and the interpretation listen,img2poems
8610,when i speak the wigwam trembles,shakes the sacred lodge with terror,hands unseen begin to shake it,img2poems
8611,ay,why do the living said they,lay such heavy burdens on us,img2poems
8612,'t was a youth of sixteen summers,'t was a nephew of iagoo,face-in-a-mist the people called him,img2poems
8613,i will slay this pau-puk-keewis,slay this mischief-maker,said he,img2poems
8614,make me large said pau-puk-keewis,make me large and make me larger,larger than the other beavers,img2poems
8615,here they made him large and larger,made him largest of the beavers,ten times larger than the others,img2poems
8616,death to kwasind,was the sudden,war-cry of the little people,img2poems
8617,then he turned and saw the strangers,cowering crouching with the shadows,said within himself who are they,img2poems
8618,but he questioned not the strangers,only spake to bid them welcome,to his lodge his food his fireside,img2poems
8619,from the realms of chibiabos,hither have we come to try you,hither have we come to warn you,img2poems
8620,we are but a burden to you,and we see that the departed,have no place among the living,img2poems
8621,cried he with his face uplifted,in that bitter hour of anguish,give your children food o father,img2poems
8622,no my child,said old nokomis,'t is the night-wind in the pine-trees,img2poems
8623,in his lodge beside a river,close beside a frozen river,sat an old man sad and lonely,img2poems
8624,ah my son,exclaimed the old man,happy are my eyes to see you,img2poems
8625,at each other looked the warriors,looked the women at each other,smiled and said it cannot be so,img2poems
8626,from its mouth he said to greet him,came waywassimo the lightning,came the thunder annemeekee,img2poems
8627,gitche manito the mighty,the great spirit the creator,sends them hither on his errand,img2poems
8628,i beheld too in that vision,all the secrets of the future,of the distant days that shall be,img2poems
8629,or the white goose waw-be-wawa,with the water dripping flashing,from its glossy neck and feathers,img2poems
8630,i am going o nokomis,on a long and distant journey,to the portals of the sunset,img2poems
8631,and the forests dark and lonely,moved through all their depths of darkness,sighed farewell o hiawatha,img2poems
8632,and the waves upon the margin,rising rippling on the pebbles,sobbed farewell o hiawatha,img2poems
8633,thus departed hiawatha,hiawatha the beloved,in the glory of the sunset,img2poems
8634,the scene of the poem is among the ojibways on the southern shore of,lake superior in the region between the pictured rocks and the,grand sable,img2poems
8635,thereupon answered john alden but looked not up from his writing,truly the breath of the lord hath slackened the speed of the bullet,he in his mercy preserved you to be our shield and our weapon,img2poems
8636,still the captain continued unheeding the words of the stripling,see how bright they are burnished as if in an arsenal hanging,that is because i have done it myself and not left it to others,img2poems
8637,green above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there,better to hide from the indian scouts the graves of our people,lest they should count them and see how many already have perished,img2poems
8638,nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling,busily writing epistles important to go by the mayflower,ready to sail on the morrow or next day at latest god willing,img2poems
8639,homeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter,letters written by alden and full of the name of priscilla,full of the name and the fame of the puritan maiden priscilla,img2poems
8640,go to the damsel priscilla the loveliest maiden of plymouth,say that a blunt old captain a man not of words but of actions,offers his hand and his heart the hand and heart of a soldier,img2poems
8641,you who are bred as a scholar can say it in elegant language,such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers,such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden,img2poems
8642,to and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing,as in a foundering ship with every roll of the vessel,washes the bitter sea the merciless surge of the ocean,img2poems
8643,truly the heart is deceitful and out of its depths of corruption,rise like an exhalation the misty phantoms of passion,angels of light they seem but are only delusions of satan,img2poems
8644,this is the hand of the lord it is laid upon me in anger,for i have followed too much the heart's desires and devices,worshipping astaroth blindly and impious idols of baal,img2poems
8645,had he but spoken then,perhaps not in vain had he spoken,now it was all too late the golden moment had vanished,img2poems
8646,yours is tender and trusting and needs a stronger to lean on,so i have come to you now with an offer and proffer of marriage,made by a good man and true miles standish the captain of plymouth,img2poems
8647,welcome o wind of the east,he exclaimed in his wild exultation,welcome o wind of the east from the caves of the misty atlantic,img2poems
8648,fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending,love triumphant and crowned and friendship wounded and bleeding,passionate cries of desire and importunate pleadings of duty,img2poems
8649,still for a moment he stood and listened and stared at the vessel,then went hurriedly on as one who seeing a phantom,stops then quickens his pace and follows the beckoning shadow,img2poems
8650,better to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in england,close by my mother's side and among the dust of my kindred,better be dead and forgotten than living in shame and dishonor,img2poems
8651,soon he entered his door and found the redoubtable captain,sitting alone and absorbed in the martial pages of caesar,fighting some great campaign in hainault or brabant or flanders,img2poems
8652,not far off is the house although the woods are between us,but you have lingered so long that while you were going and coming,i have fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city,img2poems
8653,but in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway,bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance,rumors of danger and war and hostile incursions of indians,img2poems
8654,straightway the captain paused and without further question or parley,took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron,buckled the belt round his waist and frowning fiercely departed,img2poems
8655,alden was left alone,he heard the clank of the scabbard,growing fainter and fainter and dying away in the distance,img2poems
8656,god had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting,then had sifted the wheat as the living seed of a nation,so say the chronicles old and such is the faith of the people,img2poems
8657,but unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the captain,who had advanced to the table and thus continued discoursing,leave this matter to me for to me by right it pertaineth,img2poems
8658,silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage,bearing the serpent's skin and seeming himself like a serpent,winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest,img2poems
8659,just in the gray of the dawn as the mists uprose from the meadows,there was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of plymouth,clanging and clicking of arms and the order imperative forward,img2poems
8660,standish the stalwart it was with eight of his valorous army,led by their indian guide by hobomok friend of the white men,northward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage,img2poems
8661,giants they seemed in the mist or the mighty men of king david,giants in heart they were who believed in god and the bible,ay who believed in the smiting of midianites and philistines,img2poems
8662,over them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning,under them loud on the sands the serried billows advancing,fired along the line and in regular order retreated,img2poems
8663,foremost among them was alden,all night he had lain without slumber,turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever,img2poems
8664,he had beheld miles standish who came back late from the council,stalking into the room and heard him mutter and murmur,sometimes it seemed a prayer and sometimes it sounded like swearing,img2poems
8665,once he had come to the bed and stood there a moment in silence,then he had turned away and said: i will not awake him,let him sleep on it is best for what is the use of more talking,img2poems
8666,nearer the boat stood alden with one foot placed on the gunwale,one still firm on the rock and talking at times with the sailors,seated erect on the thwarts all ready and eager for starting,img2poems
8667,he too was eager to go and thus put an end to his anguish,thinking to fly from despair that swifter than keel is or canvas,thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him,img2poems
8668,mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock and above them,bowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death and their kindred,seemed to awake in their graves and to join in the prayer that they uttered,img2poems
8669,sun-illumined and white on the eastern verge of the ocean,gleamed the departing sail like a marble slab in a graveyard,buried beneath it lay for ever all hope of escaping,img2poems
8670,what i thought was a flower is only a weed and is worthless,out of my heart will i pluck it and throw it away and henceforward,be but a fighter of battles a lover and wooer of dangers,img2poems
8671,thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort,while he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest,looking up at the trees and the constellations beyond them,img2poems
8672,braves of the tribe were these and brothers gigantic in stature,huge as goliath of gath or the terrible og king of bashan,one was pecksuot named and the other was called wattawamat,img2poems
8673,welcome english,they said these words they had learned from the traders,touching at times on the coast to barter and chaffer for peltries,img2poems
8674,but when he heard their defiance the boast the taunt and the insult,all the hot blood of his race of sir hugh and of thurston de standish,boiled and beat in his heart and swelled in the veins of his temples,img2poems
8675,headlong he leaped on the boaster and snatching his knife from its scabbard,plunged it into his heart and reeling backward the savage,fell with his face to the sky and a fiendlike fierceness upon it,img2poems
8676,bravely the stalwart miles standish was scouring the land with his forces,waxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies,till his name had become a sound of fear to the nations,img2poems
8677,wooden-barred was the door and the roof was covered with rushes,latticed the windows were and the window-panes were of paper,oiled to admit the light while wind and rain were excluded,img2poems
8678,hold this skein on your hands while i wind it ready for knitting,then who knows but hereafter when fashions have changed and the manners,fathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of john alden,img2poems
8679,lo,in the midst of this scene a breathless messenger entered,bringing in hurry and heat the terrible news from the village,img2poems
8680,friends were assembled together the elder and magistrate also,graced the scene with their presence and stood like the law and the gospel,one with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven,img2poems
8681,softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal,taking each other for husband and wife in the magistrate's presence,after the puritan way and the laudable custom of holland,img2poems
8682,fervently then and devoutly the excellent elder of plymouth,prayed for the hearth and the home that were founded that day in affection,speaking of life and of death and imploring divine benedictions,img2poems
8683,lo,when the service was ended a form appeared on the threshold,clad in armor of steel a sombre and sorrowful figure,img2poems
8684,but when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction,into the room it strode and the people beheld with amazement,bodily there in his armor miles standish the captain of plymouth,img2poems
8685,i have been angry and hurt too long have i cherished the feeling,i have been cruel and hard but now thank god,it is ended,img2poems
8686,then he said with a smile: i should have remembered the adage,if you would be well served you must serve yourself and moreover,no man can gather cherries in kent at the season of christmas,img2poems
8687,soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure,friends coming forth from the house and impatient of longer delaying,each with his plan for the day and the work that was left uncompleted,img2poems
8688,somewhat alarmed at first but reassured by the others,placing her hand on the cushion her foot in the hand of her husband,gayly with joyous laugh priscilla mounted her palfrey,img2poems
8689,pleasantly murmured the brook as they crossed the ford in the forest,pleased with the image that passed like a dream of love through its bosom,tremulous floating in air o'er the depths of the azure abysses,img2poems
8690,those sounds that flow,in murmurs of delight and woe,come not from wings of birds,img2poems
8691,through the cloud-rack dark and trailing,must they see above them sailing,o'er life's barren crags the vulture,img2poems
8692,what,are these the guests whose glances,seemed like sunshine gleaming round me,img2poems
8693,these the wild bewildering fancies,that with dithyrambic dances,as with magic circles bound me,img2poems
8694,spectral gleam their snow-white dresses,and from loose dishevelled tresses,fall the hyacinthine blossoms,img2poems
8695,o my songs,whose winsome measures,filled my heart with secret rapture,img2poems
8696,for thou makest each mystery clearer,and the unattained seems nearer,when thou fillest my heart with fever,img2poems
8697,was she a lady of high degree,so much in love with the vanity,and foolish pomp of this world of ours,img2poems
8698,or was it christian charity,and lowliness and humility,the richest and rarest of all dowers,img2poems
8699,ah you will then have other cares,in your own short-comings and despairs,in your own secret sins and terrors,img2poems
8700,adding then by way of jest,golondrina is my guest,'tis the wife of some deserter,img2poems
8701,the mourners said and death is rest and peace,then added in the certainty of faith,and giveth life that never more shall cease,img2poems
8702,the groaning earth in travail and in pain,brings forth its races but does not restore,and the dead nations never rise again,img2poems
8703,its vacant eyes,stare at the skies,stare at the valley green and deep,img2poems
8704,under the walls of monterey,at daybreak the bugles began to play,victor galbraith,img2poems
8705,he looked at the earth he looked at the sky,he looked at the files of musketry,victor galbraith,img2poems
8706,three balls are in his breast and brain,but he rises out of the dust again,victor galbraith,img2poems
8707,forth dart once more those tongues of flame,and the bugler has died a death of shame,victor galbraith,img2poems
8708,under the walls of monterey,by night a bugle is heard to play,victor galbraith,img2poems
8709,and the dead captains as they lay,in their graves o'erlooking the tranquil bay,where they in battle died,img2poems
8710,and hurried landward far away,crying awake,it is the day,img2poems
8711,it shouted through the belfry-tower,awake o bell,proclaim the hour,img2poems
8712,it crossed the churchyard with a sigh,and said not yet,in quiet lie,img2poems
8713,for his voice i listen and yearn,it is growing late and dark,and my boy does not return,img2poems
8714,for i hear you at your play,and the questions that perplexed me,have vanished quite away,img2poems
8715,ah,what would the world be to us,if the children were no more,img2poems
8716,and whisper in my ear,what the birds and the winds are singing,in your sunny atmosphere,img2poems
8717,ah me,for the land that is sown,with the harvest of despair,img2poems
8718,where the burning cinders blown,from the lips of the overthrown,enceladus fill the air,img2poems
8719,and the storm-wind shouts through the pines,of alps and of apennines,enceladus arise,img2poems
8720,strike your flag,the rebel cries,in his arrogant old plantation strain,img2poems
8721,never,our gallant morris replies,it is better to sink than to yield,img2poems
8722,every waft of the air,was a whisper of prayer,or a dirge for the dead,img2poems
8723,blow winds,and waft through all the rooms,the snow-flakes of the cherry-blooms,img2poems
8724,blow winds,and bend within my reach,the fiery blossoms of the peach,img2poems
8725,o life and love,o happy throng,of thoughts whose only speech is song,img2poems
8726,o heart of man,canst thou not be,blithe as the air is and as free,img2poems
8727,a region of repose it seems,a place of slumber and of dreams,remote among the wooded hills,img2poems
8728,last the musician as he stood,illumined by that fire of wood,fair-haired blue-eyed his aspect blithe,img2poems
8729,meanwhile impatient to mount and ride,booted and spurred with a heavy stride,on the opposite shore walked paul revere,img2poems
8730,and lo,as he looks on the belfry's height,a glimmer and then a gleam of light,img2poems
8731,he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns,but lingers and gazes till full on his sight,a second lamp in the belfry burns,img2poems
8732,thus ariosto says in words,that have the stately stride and ring,of armed knights and clashing swords,img2poems
8733,beautiful falcon,said he would that i,might hold thee on my wrist or see thee fly,img2poems
8734,who is thy mother my fair boy,he said,his hand laid softly on that shining head,img2poems
8735,monna giovanna,will you let me stay,a little while and with your falcon play,img2poems
8736,rabbi ben levi on the sabbath read,a volume of the law in which it said,no man shall look upon my face and live,img2poems
8737,and as he read he prayed that god would give,his faithful servant grace with mortal eye,to look upon his face and yet not die,img2poems
8738,beyond the outer wall the angel of death,heard the great voice and said with panting breath,give back the sword and let me go my way,img2poems
8739,i am the god thor,i am the war god,i am the thunderer,img2poems
8740,here in my northland,my fastness and fortress,reign i forever,img2poems
8741,when at sea with all his rowers,he along the bending oars,outside of his ship could run,img2poems
8742,he the smalsor horn ascended,and his shining shield suspended,on its summit like a sun,img2poems
8743,thora of rimol,hide me,hide me,img2poems
8744,hakon jarl,for the love i bear thee,neither shall shame nor death come near thee,img2poems
8745,then why dost thou turn so pale o churl,and then again black as the earth,said the earl,img2poems
8746,and they answered: o queen,if the truth must be told,the ring is of copper and not of gold,img2poems
8747,why then should i care to have thee,he said,a faded old woman a heathenish jade,img2poems
8748,half my kingdom would i give,as i live,if by such songs you would earn it,img2poems
8749,hearken to me then o king,while i sing,the great ocean song that haunts me,img2poems
8750,then athwart the vapors dun,the easter sun,streamed with one broad track of splendor,img2poems
8751,in their real forms appeared,the warlocks weird,awful as the witch of endor,img2poems
8752,sing o scald your song sublime,your ocean-rhyme,cried king olaf: it will cheer me,img2poems
8753,said the scald with pallid cheeks,the skerry of shrieks,sings too loud for you to hear me,img2poems
8754,olaf the king one summer morn,blew a blast on his bugle-horn,sending his signal through the land of drontheim,img2poems
8755,and to the hus-ting held at mere,gathered the farmers far and near,with their war weapons ready to confront him,img2poems
8756,ploughing under the morning star,old iron-beard in yriar,heard the summons chuckling with a low laugh,img2poems
8757,he wiped the sweat-drops from his brow,unharnessed his horses from the plough,and clattering came on horseback to king olaf,img2poems
8758,he was the churliest of the churls,little he cared for king or earls,bitter as home-brewed ale were his foaming passions,img2poems
8759,hodden-gray was the garb he wore,and by the hammer of thor he swore,he hated the narrow town and all its fashions,img2poems
8760,but he loved the freedom of his farm,his ale at night by the fireside warm,gudrun his daughter with her flaxen tresses,img2poems
8761,he loved his horses and his herds,the smell of the earth and the song of birds,his well-filled barns his brook with its water-cresses,img2poems
8762,huge and cumbersome was his frame,his beard from which he took his name,frosty and fierce like that of hymer the giant,img2poems
8763,so at the hus-ting he appeared,the farmer of yriar iron-beard,on horseback in an attitude defiant,img2poems
8764,and to king olaf he cried aloud,out of the middle of the crowd,that tossed about him like a stormy ocean,img2poems
8765,such sacrifices shalt thou bring,to odin and to thor o king,as other kings have done in their devotion,img2poems
8766,king olaf answered: i command,this land to be a christian land,here is my bishop who the folk baptizes,img2poems
8767,but if you ask me to restore,your sacrifices stained with gore,then will i offer human sacrifices,img2poems
8768,not slaves and peasants shall they be,but men of note and high degree,such men as orm of lyra and kar of gryting,img2poems
8769,then to their temple strode he in,and loud behind him heard the din,of his men-at-arms and the peasants fiercely fighting,img2poems
8770,there in the temple carved in wood,the image of great odin stood,and other gods with thor supreme among them,img2poems
8771,king olaf smote them with the blade,of his huge war-axe gold inlaid,and downward shattered to the pavement flung them,img2poems
8772,at the same moment rose without,from the contending crowd a shout,a mingled sound of triumph and of wailing,img2poems
8773,and there upon the trampled plain,the farmer iron-beard lay slain,midway between the assailed and the assailing,img2poems
8774,and seeing their leader stark and dead,the people with a murmur said,o king baptize us with thy holy water,img2poems
8775,so all the drontheim land became,a christian land in name and fame,in the old gods no more believing and trusting,img2poems
8776,and as a blood-atonement soon,king olaf wed the fair gudrun,and thus in peace ended the drontheim hus-ting,img2poems
8777,cold will be the dagger's kiss,laden with the chill of death,is its breath,img2poems
8778,forests have ears and fields have eyes,often treachery lurking lies,underneath the fairest hair,img2poems
8779,every scald,satires scrawled,on poor thangbrand olaf's priest,img2poems
8780,o king olaf,little hope,is there of these iceland men,img2poems
8781,meekly said,with bending head,pious thangbrand olaf's priest,img2poems
8782,little time have we for speaking,choose between the good and evil,be baptized or thou shalt die,img2poems
8783,sing me a song divine,with a sword in every line,and this shall be thy reward,img2poems
8784,and he loosened the belt at his waist,and in front of the singer placed,his sword,img2poems
8785,but the king said o my son,i miss the bright word in one,of thy measures and thy rhymes,img2poems
8786,and halfred the scald replied,in another 't was multiplied,three times,img2poems
8787,and halfred the scald said this,in the name of the lord i kiss,who on it was crucified,img2poems
8788,and a shout went round the board,in the name of christ the lord,who died,img2poems
8789,could you not be gone a minute,but some mischief must be doing,turning bad to worse,img2poems
8790,they who to the saga listened,heard the name of thorberg skafting,for a hundred year,img2poems
8791,thirty men they each commanded,iron-sinewed horny-handed,shoulders broad and chests expanded,img2poems
8792,when they landed from the fleet,how they roared through drontheim's street,boisterous as the gale,img2poems
8793,never saw the wild north sea,such a gallant company,sail its billows blue,img2poems
8794,the king yes olaf the king,has wedded her with his ring,and thyri is queen in the land,img2poems
8795,i your pilot will be,for i know all the channels,where flows the deep sea,img2poems
8796,king olaf laid an arrow on string,have i a coward on board,said he,img2poems
8797,sullenly answered ulf,the old sea-wolf,you have need of me,img2poems
8798,what was that,said olaf standing,on the quarter-deck,img2poems
8799,it is accepted,the angry defiance,the challenge of battle,img2poems
8800,it is accepted,but not with the weapons,of war that thou wieldest,img2poems
8801,cross against corselet,love against hatred,peace-cry for war-cry,img2poems
8802,patience is powerful,he that o'ercometh,hath power o'er the nations,img2poems
8803,the dawn is not distant,nor is the night starless,love is eternal,img2poems
8804,god is still god and,his faith shall not fail us,christ is eternal,img2poems
8805,and all translated in the air,reach me but as our dear lord's prayer,and as the sermon on the mount,img2poems
8806,o pitiless skies,why did your clouds retain,for peasants' fields their floods of hoarded rain,img2poems
8807,o pitiless earth,why open no abyss,to bury in its chasm a crime like this,img2poems
8808,then from his house a temple painted white,with fluted columns and a roof of red,the squire came forth august and splendid sight,img2poems
8809,or a few cherries that are not so sweet,as are the songs these uninvited guests,sing at their feast with comfortable breasts,img2poems
8810,of empty nests that cling to boughs and beams,as in an idiot's brain remembered words,hang empty 'mid the cobwebs of his dreams,img2poems

9188,in his room overhead,i heard him walking across the floor,as he always does with a heavy tread,img2poems
9189,poor prince alas,and yet as mild,and patient as the gentlest child,img2poems
9190,no not the stork by god in heaven,as a blessing the dear white stork was given,but the prince has given us all the rest,img2poems
9191,yes if the dear god does not take,pity upon him in his distress,and work a miracle,img2poems
9192,i am glad he is dead,it will be a warning,to the wolves in the forest far and wide,img2poems
9193,see how she nods her heavy head,and her sleepy feet are so unsteady,she will hardly be able to creep upstairs,img2poems
9194,for she has visions and strange dreams,and in all her words and ways she seems,much older than she is in truth,img2poems
9195,i am disturbed and much distressed,in thinking our dear prince must die,i cannot close mine eyes nor rest,img2poems
9196,what dost thou mean,my child,my child,img2poems
9197,that for our dear prince henry's sake,i will myself the offering make,and give my life to purchase his,img2poems
9198,i saw our little gertrude die,she left off breathing and no more,i smoothed the pillow beneath her head,img2poems

9202,whether it be a dark temptation,of the evil one or god's inspiration,we in our blindness cannot say,img2poems

9209,i wonder that any man has the face,to call such a hole the house of the lord,and the gate of heaven yet such is the word,img2poems
9210,underneath this mouldering tomb,with statue of stone and scutcheon of brass,slumbers a great lord of the village,img2poems
9211,he comes,in the twilight he will not see,the difference between his priest and me,img2poems
9212,remorseful penitent and lowly,i come to crave o father holy,thy benediction on my head,img2poems
9213,thou art a prince,if thou shouldst die,what hearts and hopes would prostrate lie,img2poems

9222,sleepless and restless i alone,in the dusk and damp of these walls of stone,wander and weep in my remorse,img2poems
9223,they rise up and their garments wave,dimly and spectral as they rise,with the light of another world in their eyes,img2poems
9224,wake not beloved,be thy sleep,silent as night is and as deep,img2poems
9225,friend,can you tell me where alight,thuringia's horsemen for the night,img2poems

9318,hark,what sweet sounds are those whose accents holy,fill the warm noon with music sad and sweet,img2poems

9535,and there are persons here who know the truth,of what has now been said,what answer make you,img2poems
9536,did you not,on one occasion hide your husband's saddle,to hinder him from coming to the sessions,img2poems

9630,dear countess,if loyalty to friendship be a claim,upon your confidence then i may claim it,img2poems
9631,but the inward life,that you know not 't is known but to myself,and is to me a mystery and a pain,img2poems

9634,for i confess to live among my friends,is paradise to me my purgatory,is living among people i dislike,img2poems

9636,that is a task impossible until,you tune your heart-strings to a higher key,than earthly melodies,img2poems
9637,but lead me privately so that the world,hear not my steps i would not give occasion,for talk among the people,img2poems
9638,do me the kindness then,to speak without reserve and with all frankness,if you divine the truth will i confess it,img2poems

9653,the men that women marry,and why they marry them will always be,a marvel and a mystery to the world,img2poems
9654,and then the duchess how shall i describe her,or tell the merits of that happy nature,which pleases most when least it thinks of pleasing,img2poems

9670,i cannot go,the sibylline leaves of life,grow precious now when only few remain,img2poems
9671,i seem to hear her hearing the boughs and breezes,and leaves and birds lamenting and the waters,murmuring flee along the verdant herbage,img2poems
9672,i beg you to take note of what he says,about the papal seals for that concerns,your office and yourself,img2poems

9678,i have but words of praise and admiration,for his great genius and the world is fairer,that he lived in it,img2poems
9679,each one performs his life-work and then leaves it,those that come after him will estimate,his influence on the age in which he lived,img2poems
9680,so you have left at last your still lagoons,your city of silence floating in the sea,and come to us in rome,img2poems

9682,i felt so once but i have grown familiar,with desolation and it has become,no more a pain to me but a delight,img2poems
9683,and paints with fires,sudden and splendid as the lightning paints,the cloudy vault of heaven,img2poems
9684,indeed i know not,'t was a foolish boast,and does no harm to any but himself,img2poems
9685,when you two,are gone who is there that remains behind,to seize the pencil falling from your fingers,img2poems
9686,i hear,your son orazio and your nephew marco,mentioned with honor,img2poems
9687,that acrisius did well,to lock such beauty in a brazen tower,and hide it from all eyes,img2poems
9688,and more that you were present,and saw the showery jove from high olympus,descend in all his splendor,img2poems
9689,messer michele all the arts are yours,not one alone and therefore i may venture,to put a question to you,img2poems
9690,how from the canvas they detach themselves,till they deceive the eye and one would say,it is a statue with a screen behind it,img2poems
9691,and now maestro i will say once more,how admirable i esteem your work,and leave you without further interruption,img2poems
9692,death is the chillness that precedes the dawn,we shudder for a moment then awake,in the broad sunshine of the other life,img2poems

9694,do you remember julia when we walked,one afternoon upon the castle terrace,at ischia on the day before you left me,img2poems
9695,oh do not speak of him,his sudden death,o'ercomes me now as it o'ercame me then,img2poems
9696,therefore be cautious,keep your secret thought,locked in your breast,img2poems
9697,not pale but whiter than the sheet of snows,that without wind on some fair hill-top lies,her weary body seemed to find repose,img2poems
9698,like a sweet slumber in her lovely eyes,when now the spirit was no longer there,was what is dying called by the unwise,img2poems
9699,how wonderful,the light upon her face,shines from the windows of another world,img2poems
9700,i must then the short-coming of my means,piece out by stepping forward as the spartan,was told to add a step to his short sword,img2poems
9701,death's lightnings strike to right and left of me,and like a ruined wall the world around me,crumbles away and i am left alone,img2poems
9702,when one pope dies another is soon made,and i can make a dozen cardinals,but cannot make one michael angelo,img2poems
9703,you cardinal salviati,are an old man,are you incapable,img2poems
9704,i have seen his model,and have approved it,but here comes the artist,img2poems
9705,beware of him,he may make persians of you,to carry burdens on your backs forever,img2poems
9706,come forward dear maestro,in these gardens,all ceremonies of our court are banished,img2poems
9707,how graciously,your holiness commiserates old age,and its infirmities,img2poems
9708,i would advise,your holiness not to cross it or not often,it is not safe,img2poems
9709,there is some mystery here,these cardinals,stand lowering at me with unfriendly eyes,img2poems
9710,deputies,of the commissioners and they complain,of insufficient light in the three chapels,img2poems
9711,monsignore,perhaps you do not know that in the vaulting,above there are to go three other windows,img2poems

9715,the same reason,that keeps you standing sentinel at your door,the air of this delicious summer morning,img2poems

9718,tradition says that fifteen thousand men,were toiling for ten years incessantly,upon this amphitheatre,img2poems
9719,think you that i approve such cruelties,because i marvel at the architects,who built these walls and curved these noble arches,img2poems

9870,then made he sign of holy rood upon them,whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,and he departed swiftly as he came,img2poems
9871,already my slow steps had led me on,into the ancient wood so far that i,could see no more the place where i had entered,img2poems
9872,that they might fear thee more or love thee less,who in the splendor of thy loveliness,seem wasting yet to mortal combat dare,img2poems
9873,if by its nature unto heaven returns,this element me kindled in its blaze,will it bear upward when my life is fled,img2poems
9874,the dreams of love that were so sweet of yore,what are they now when two deaths may be mine,one sure and one forecasting its alarms,img2poems
9875,painting and sculpture satisfy no more,the soul now turning to the love divine,that oped to embrace us on the cross its arms,img2poems
9876,vainly did cruel death attempt to stay,the rumor of thy virtuous renown,that lethe's waters could not wash away,img2poems
9877,a thousand leaves since he hath stricken thee down,speak of thee nor to thee could heaven convey,except through death a refuge and a crown,img2poems
9878,among a thousand proofs let one suffice,that as his exile hath no parallel,ne'er walked the earth a greater man than he,img2poems

9880,let thy proud heart relent,come back to my tall white tent,come back my only son,img2poems
9881,where are our shallow fords,and where,the power of kazan with its fourfold gates,img2poems

9883,i go to the river there below,where in bunches the violets grow,and sun and shadow meet,img2poems
9884,i go to the garden in the vale,where all night long the nightingale,her love-song doth repeat,img2poems
9885,welcome o stork,that dost wing,thy flight from the far-away,img2poems
9886,we our country's bounds and pleasant pastures relinquish,we our country fly thou tityrus stretched in the shadow,teachest the woods to resound with the name of the fair amaryllis,img2poems
9887,o meliboeus a god for us this leisure created,for he will be unto me a god forever his altar,oftentimes shall imbue a tender lamb from our sheepfolds,img2poems
9888,though from my wattled folds there went forth many a victim,and the unctuous cheese was pressed for the city ungrateful,never did my right hand return home heavy with money,img2poems
9889,tityrus hence was absent,thee tityrus even the pine-trees,thee the very fountains the very copses were calling,img2poems
9890,what could i do,no power had i to escape from my bondage,nor had i power elsewhere to recognize gods so propitious,img2poems
9891,fortunate old man,here among familiar rivers,and these sacred founts shalt thou take the shadowy coolness,img2poems
9892,on this side a hedge along the neighboring cross-road,where hyblaean bees ever feed on the flower of the willow,often with gentle susurrus to fall asleep shall persuade thee,img2poems
9893,yonder beneath the high rock the pruner shall sing to the breezes,nor meanwhile shalt thy heart's delight the hoarse wood-pigeons,nor the turtle-dove cease to mourn from aerial elm-trees,img2poems
9894,sooner the border-lands of both overpassed shall the exiled,parthian drink of the soane or the german drink of the tigris,than the face of him shall glide away from my bosom,img2poems
9895,but we hence shall go a part to the thirsty afries,part to scythia come and the rapid cretan oaxes,and to the britons from all the universe utterly sundered,img2poems
9896,ah shall i ever a long time hence the bounds of my country,and the roof of my lowly cottage covered with greensward,seeing with wonder behold my kingdoms a handful of wheat-ears,img2poems
9897,naked and barren plains without leaves or trees we behold here,places alas,unto which no happy man would repair,img2poems
9898,where is the thatch-roofed village the home of acadian farmers,men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands,darkened by shadows of earth but reflecting an image of heaven,img2poems
9899,neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows,but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners,there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance,img2poems
9900,when in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide,flagons of home-brewed ale ah,fair in sooth was the maiden,img2poems
9901,bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey,till the hives overflowed and the indian hunters asserted,cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes,img2poems
9902,silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle,while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe,followed the old man's song and united the fragments together,img2poems
9903,meanwhile apart in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure,sat the lovers and whispered together beholding the moon rise,over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows,img2poems
9904,silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,raising his eyes full of tears to the silent stars that above them,moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals,img2poems
9905,gabriel lajeunesse,they said o yes,we have seen him,img2poems
9906,onward o'er sunken sands through a wilderness somber with forests,day after day they glided adown the turbulent river,night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders,img2poems
9907,deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons,home to their roosts in the cedar-trees returning at sunset,or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter,img2poems
9908,nearer and ever nearer among the numberless islands,darted a light swift boat that sped away o'er the water,urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers,img2poems
9909,gabriel truly is near thee for not far away to the southward,maur and st,martin,img2poems
9910,full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas,hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grape-vines,img2poems
9911,thus they ascended the steps and crossing the airy veranda,entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil,waited his late return and they rested and feasted together,img2poems
9912,so seemed it wise and well unto all and betimes on the morrow,mounting his mexican steed with his indian guides and companions,homeward basil returned and evangeline stayed at the mission,img2poems
9913,then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens,blushed at each blood-red ear for that betokened a lover,but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the cornfield,img2poems
9914,and with returning guides that sought the lakes of st,lawrence,saying a sad farewell evangeline went from the mission,img2poems
9915,then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead,dawn of another life that broke o'er her earthly horizon,as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning,img2poems
9916,in the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy,maidens still wear their norman caps and their kirtles of homespun,and by the evening fire repeat evangeline's story,img2poems
9917,in reading there should be a gentle labor of the former half of the,line and gentle acceleration of the latter half,scudder,img2poems
9918,the english were not without blame since it must be admitted they had,covetous eyes upon the rich farms of the acadians and an opportunity to take,possession of them would not be unwelcome,img2poems
9919,rameau who has made a much deeper study than,any other historian of the acadians sets the total at  comprising,horned cattle horses sheep and pigs,img2poems
9920,the author contrasts the clamor of the throng and the quiet words of,father felician by referring to rapid strokes of the alarm and the quiet,measured strokes of the hour,img2poems

10551,and oh behind the cloud-sheaves like yellow autumn,dapples,did you see the wicked sun that winked,img2poems
10552,i have fetched the tears up out of the little wells,scooped them up with small iron words,dripping over the runnels,img2poems
10553,the harsh cold wind of my words drove on and still,i watched the tears on the guilty cheek of the boys,glitter and spill,img2poems
10554,if i could have put you in my heart,if but i could have wrapped you in myself,how glad i should have been,img2poems
10555,and oh that you had never never been,some of your selves my love that some,of your several faces i had never seen,img2poems
10556,nay but she sleeps like a bride and dreams her,dreams,of perfect things,img2poems
10557,she lies at last the darling in the shape of her dream,and her dead mouth sings,by its shape like the thrushes in clear evenings,img2poems
10558,two and two are the folk that walk,they pass in a half embrace,with dark face leaning to face,img2poems
10559,so i am not lonely nor sad,although bereaved of you,my little love,img2poems
10560,i move among a kinsfolk clad,with words but the dream shows through,as they move,img2poems
10561,earth of my swaying atmosphere,substance of my inconstant breath,i cannot but cleave to you,img2poems
10562,your presence peering lonelily there,oppresses me so i can hardly bear,to share the train with you,img2poems
10563,yet closely bitten in to me,is this armour of stiff reluctancy,that keeps me impounded,img2poems
10564,for i ache most earnestly for your touch,yet i cannot move however much,i would be your lover,img2poems
10565,will you open the amorous aching bud,of my body and loose the burning flood,that would leap to you from my heart,img2poems
10566,she clung to the door in her haste to enter,entered and quickly cast,it shut behind her leaving the street aghast,img2poems
10567,oh let us here forget let us take the sheer,unknown that lies before us bearing the ark,of the covenant onwards where she cannot go,img2poems
10568,do i not know the darkness within them,what,are they but shrouds,img2poems
10569,runs like a fretted arc-lamp into light,stirred by conflict to shining which else,were dark and whole with the night,img2poems
10570,runs to a fret of speed like a racing wheel,which else were aslumber along with the whole,of the dark swinging rhythmic instead of a-reel,img2poems
10571,leaps like a fountain of blue sparks leaping,in a jet from out of obscurity,which erst was darkness sleeping,img2poems
10572,runs into streams of bright blue drops,water and stones and stars and myriads,of twin-blue eyes and crops,img2poems
10573,of floury grain and all the hosts of day,all lovely hosts of ripples caused by fretting,the darkness into play,img2poems
10574,then suddenly she looked up,and i was blind in a tawny-gold day,till she took her eyes away,img2poems
10575,so i held my heart aloft,to the cuckoo that hung like a dove,and she settled soft,img2poems
10576,i echoed with surprise,hearing my mere lips shout,the answer they did devise,img2poems
10577,mournfully to and fro to and fro the trees are,waving,what did you say my dear,img2poems
10578,one lonely bell one only the storm-tossed afternoon,is braving,why not let it ring,img2poems
10579,a wet bird walks on the lawn call to the boy to come,and look,yes it is over now,img2poems
10580,he cannot see it i can never show it him how it,shook,don't disturb him darling,img2poems
10581,i look at the swaling sunset,and wish i could go also,through the red doors beyond the black-purple bar,img2poems
10582,then i would turn round,and seeing my cast-off body lying like lumber,i would laugh with joy,img2poems
10583,out of the darkness fretted sometimes in its sleeping,jets of sparks in fountains of blue come leaping,to sight revealing a secret numberless secrets keeping,img2poems
10584,sometimes the darkness trapped within a wheel,runs into speed like a dream the blue of the steel,showing the rocking darkness now a-reel,img2poems
10585,and all the manifold blue and joyous eyes,the rainbow arching over in the skies,new sparks of wonder opening in surprise,img2poems

10589,inferno,purgatorio,paradiso,img2poems
10590,io non so ben ridir com' i' v'intrai,tant' era pien di sonno a quel punto,che la verace via abbandonai,img2poems
10591,allor fu la paura un poco queta,che nel lago del cor m'era durata,la notte ch'i' passai con tanta pieta,img2poems
10592,e come quei che con lena affannata,uscito fuor del pelago a la riva,si volge a l'acqua perigliosa e guata,img2poems
10593,ed ecco quasi al cominciar de l'erta,una lonza leggera e presta molto,che di pel macolato era coverta,img2poems
10594,questa mi porse tanto di gravezza,con la paura ch'uscia di sua vista,ch'io perdei la speranza de l'altezza,img2poems
10595,mentre ch'i' rovinava in basso loco,dinanzi a li occhi mi si fu offerto,chi per lungo silenzio parea fioco,img2poems
10596,tu se' lo mio maestro e 'l mio autore,tu se' solo colui da cu' io tolsi,lo bello stilo che m'ha fatto onore,img2poems
10597,vedi la bestia per cu' io mi volsi,aiutami da lei famoso saggio,ch'ella mi fa tremar le vene e i polsi,img2poems
10598,ove udirai le disperate strida,vedrai li antichi spiriti dolenti,ch'a la seconda morte ciascun grida,img2poems
10599,lo giorno se n'andava e l'aere bruno,toglieva li animai che sono in terra,da le fatiche loro e io sol uno,img2poems
10600,non pare indegno ad omo d'intelletto,ch'e' fu de l'alma roma e di suo impero,ne l'empireo ciel per padre eletto,img2poems
10601,la quale e 'l quale a voler dir lo vero,fu stabilita per lo loco santo,u' siede il successor del maggior piero,img2poems
10602,per quest' andata onde li dai tu vanto,intese cose che furon cagione,di sua vittoria e del papale ammanto,img2poems
10603,per che se del venire io m'abbandono,temo che la venuta non sia folle,se' savio intendi me' ch'i' non ragiono,img2poems
10604,i' son beatrice che ti faccio andare,vegno del loco ove tornar disio,amor mi mosse che mi fa parlare,img2poems
10605,ma dimmi la cagion che non ti guardi,de lo scender qua giuso in questo centro,de l'ampio loco ove tornar tu ardi,img2poems
10606,da che tu vuo' saver cotanto a dentro,dirotti brievemente mi rispuose,perch' i' non temo di venir qua entro,img2poems
10607,questa chiese lucia in suo dimando,e disse: or ha bisogno il tuo fedele,di te e io a te lo raccomando,img2poems
10608,lucia nimica di ciascun crudele,si mosse e venne al loco dov' i' era,che mi sedea con l'antica rachele,img2poems
10609,non odi tu la pieta del suo pianto,non vedi tu la morte che 'l combatte,su la fiumana ove 'l mar non ha vanto,img2poems
10610,al mondo non fur mai persone ratte,a far lor pro o a fuggir lor danno,com' io dopo cotai parole fatte,img2poems
10611,poscia che tai tre donne benedette,curan di te ne la corte del cielo,e 'l mio parlar tanto ben ti promette,img2poems
10612,quali fioretti dal notturno gelo,chinati e chiusi poi che 'l sol li 'mbianca,si drizzan tutti aperti in loro stelo,img2poems
10613,tal mi fec' io di mia virtude stanca,e tanto buono ardire al cor mi corse,ch'i' cominciai come persona franca,img2poems
10614,dinanzi a me non fuor cose create,se non etterne e io etterno duro,lasciate ogne speranza voi ch'intrate,img2poems
10615,noi siam venuti al loco ov' i' t'ho detto,che tu vedrai le genti dolorose,c'hanno perduto il ben de l'intelletto,img2poems
10616,e poi che la sua mano a la mia puose,con lieto volto ond' io mi confortai,mi mise dentro a le segrete cose,img2poems
10617,quivi sospiri pianti e alti guai,risonavan per l'aere sanza stelle,per ch'io al cominciar ne lagrimai,img2poems
10618,diverse lingue orribili favelle,parole di dolore accenti d'ira,voci alte e fioche e suon di man con elle,img2poems
10619,facevano un tumulto il qual s'aggira,sempre in quell' aura sanza tempo tinta,come la rena quando turbo spira,img2poems
10620,fama di loro il mondo esser non lassa,misericordia e giustizia li sdegna,non ragioniam di lor ma guarda e passa,img2poems
10621,e io che riguardai vidi una 'nsegna,che girando correva tanto ratta,che d'ogne posa mi parea indegna,img2poems
10622,poscia ch'io v'ebbi alcun riconosciuto,vidi e conobbi l'ombra di colui,che fece per viltade il gran rifiuto,img2poems
10623,incontanente intesi e certo fui,che questa era la setta d'i cattivi,a dio spiacenti e a' nemici sui,img2poems
10624,questi sciaurati che mai non fur vivi,erano ignudi e stimolati molto,da mosconi e da vespe ch'eran ivi,img2poems
10625,elle rigavan lor di sangue il volto,che mischiato di lagrime a' lor piedi,da fastidiosi vermi era ricolto,img2poems
10626,allor con li occhi vergognosi e bassi,temendo no 'l mio dir li fosse grave,infino al fiume del parlar mi trassi,img2poems
10627,non isperate mai veder lo cielo,i' vegno per menarvi a l'altra riva,ne le tenebre etterne in caldo e 'n gelo,img2poems
10628,quinci fuor quete le lanose gote,al nocchier de la livida palude,che 'ntorno a li occhi avea di fiamme rote,img2poems
10629,ma quell' anime ch'eran lasse e nude,cangiar colore e dibattero i denti,ratto che 'nteser le parole crude,img2poems
10630,bestemmiavano dio e lor parenti,l'umana spezie e 'l loco e 'l tempo e 'l seme,di lor semenza e di lor nascimenti,img2poems
10631,poi si ritrasser tutte quante insieme,forte piangendo a la riva malvagia,ch'attende ciascun uom che dio non teme,img2poems
10632,caron dimonio con occhi di bragia,loro accennando tutte le raccoglie,batte col remo qualunque s'adagia,img2poems
10633,come d'autunno si levan le foglie,l'una appresso de l'altra fin che 'l ramo,vede a la terra tutte le sue spoglie,img2poems
10634,similemente il mal seme d'adamo,gittansi di quel lito ad una ad una,per cenni come augel per suo richiamo,img2poems
10635,e l'occhio riposato intorno mossi,dritto levato e fiso riguardai,per conoscer lo loco dov' io fossi,img2poems
10636,oscura e profonda era e nebulosa,tanto che per ficcar lo viso a fondo,io non vi discernea alcuna cosa,img2poems
10637,quivi secondo che per ascoltare,non avea pianto mai che di sospiri,che l'aura etterna facevan tremare,img2poems
10638,e s'e' furon dinanzi al cristianesmo,non adorar debitamente a dio,e di questi cotai son io medesmo,img2poems
10639,per tai difetti non per altro rio,semo perduti e sol di tanto offesi,che sanza speme vivemo in disio,img2poems
10640,e altri molti e feceli beati,e vo' che sappi che dinanzi ad essi,spiriti umani non eran salvati,img2poems
10641,non lasciavam l'andar perch' ei dicessi,ma passavam la selva tuttavia,la selva dico di spiriti spessi,img2poems
10642,non era lunga ancor la nostra via,di qua dal sonno quand' io vidi un foco,ch'emisperio di tenebre vincia,img2poems
10643,da ch'ebber ragionato insieme alquanto,volsersi a me con salutevol cenno,e 'l mio maestro sorrise di tanto,img2poems
10644,questo passammo come terra dura,per sette porte intrai con questi savi,giugnemmo in prato di fresca verdura,img2poems
10645,vidi cammilla e la pantasilea,da l'altra parte vidi 'l re latino,che con lavina sua figlia sedea,img2poems
10646,la sesta compagnia in due si scema,per altra via mi mena il savio duca,fuor de la queta ne l'aura che trema,img2poems
10647,dico che quando l'anima mal nata,li vien dinanzi tutta si confessa,e quel conoscitor de le peccata,img2poems
10648,la bufera infernal che mai non resta,mena li spirti con la sua rapina,voltando e percotendo li molesta,img2poems
10649,elena vedi per cui tanto reo,tempo si volse e vedi 'l grande achille,che con amore al fine combatteo,img2poems
10650,quali colombe dal disio chiamate,con l'ali alzate e ferme al dolce nido,vegnon per l'aere dal voler portate,img2poems
10651,di quel che udire e che parlar vi piace,noi udiremo e parleremo a voi,mentre che 'l vento come fa ci tace,img2poems
10652,siede la terra dove nata fui,su la marina dove 'l po discende,per aver pace co' seguaci sui,img2poems
10653,amor ch'al cor gentil ratto s'apprende,prese costui de la bella persona,che mi fu tolta e 'l modo ancor m'offende,img2poems
10654,amor condusse noi ad una morte,caina attende chi a vita ci spense,queste parole da lor ci fuor porte,img2poems
10655,ma dimmi: al tempo d'i dolci sospiri,a che e come concedette amore,che conosceste i dubbiosi disiri,img2poems
10656,noi leggiavamo un giorno per diletto,di lancialotto come amor lo strinse,soli eravamo e sanza alcun sospetto,img2poems
10657,novi tormenti e novi tormentati,mi veggio intorno come ch'io mi mova,e ch'io mi volga e come che io guati,img2poems
10658,grandine grossa acqua tinta e neve,per l'aere tenebroso si riversa,pute la terra che questo riceve,img2poems
10659,li occhi ha vermigli la barba unta e atra,e 'l ventre largo e unghiate le mani,graffia li spirti ed iscoia ed isquatra,img2poems
10660,urlar li fa la pioggia come cani,de l'un de' lati fanno a l'altro schermo,volgonsi spesso i miseri profani,img2poems
10661,quando ci scorse cerbero il gran vermo,le bocche aperse e mostrocci le sanne,non avea membro che tenesse fermo,img2poems
10662,voi cittadini mi chiamaste ciacco,per la dannosa colpa de la gola,come tu vedi a la pioggia mi fiacco,img2poems
10663,giusti son due e non vi sono intesi,superbia invidia e avarizia sono,le tre faville c'hanno i cuori accesi,img2poems
10664,quali dal vento le gonfiate vele,caggiono avvolte poi che l'alber fiacca,tal cadde a terra la fiera crudele,img2poems
10665,ahi giustizia di dio,tante chi stipa,nove travaglie e pene quant' io viddi,img2poems
10666,poi si volgea ciascun quand' era giunto,per lo suo mezzo cerchio a l'altra giostra,e io ch'avea lo cor quasi compunto,img2poems
10667,assai la voce lor chiaro l'abbaia,quando vegnono a' due punti del cerchio,dove colpa contraria li dispaia,img2poems
10668,questi fuor cherci che non han coperchio,piloso al capo e papi e cardinali,in cui usa avarizia il suo soperchio,img2poems
10669,in etterno verranno a li due cozzi,questi resurgeranno del sepulcro,col pugno chiuso e questi coi crin mozzi,img2poems
10670,mal dare e mal tener lo mondo pulcro,ha tolto loro e posti a questa zuffa,qual ella sia parole non ci appulcro,img2poems
10671,or puoi figliuol veder la corta buffa,d'i ben che son commessi a la fortuna,per che l'umana gente si rabbuffa,img2poems
10672,che permutasse a tempo li ben vani,di gente in gente e d'uno in altro sangue,oltre la difension d'i senni umani,img2poems
10673,noi ricidemmo il cerchio a l'altra riva,sovr' una fonte che bolle e riversa,per un fossato che da lei deriva,img2poems
10674,e io che di mirare stava inteso,vidi genti fangose in quel pantano,ignude tutte con sembiante offeso,img2poems
10675,queste si percotean non pur con mano,ma con la testa e col petto e coi piedi,troncandosi co' denti a brano a brano,img2poems
10676,lo duca mio discese ne la barca,e poi mi fece intrare appresso lui,e sol quand' io fui dentro parve carca,img2poems
10677,fossero,ch'entro l'affoca le dimostra rosse,come tu vedi in questo basso inferno,img2poems
10678,noi pur giugnemmo dentro a l'alte fosse,che vallan quella terra sconsolata,le mura mi parean che ferro fosse,img2poems
10679,va per lo regno de la morta gente,e 'l savio mio maestro fece segno,di voler lor parlar segretamente,img2poems
10680,chiuser le porte que' nostri avversari,nel petto al mio segnor che fuor rimase,e rivolsesi a me con passi rari,img2poems
10681,ma nondimen paura il suo dir dienne,perch' io traeva la parola tronca,forse a peggior sentenzia che non tenne,img2poems
10682,di poco era di me la carne nuda,ch'ella mi fece intrar dentr' a quel muro,per trarne un spirto del cerchio di giuda,img2poems
10683,e con idre verdissime eran cinte,serpentelli e ceraste avien per crine,onde le fiere tempie erano avvinte,img2poems
10684,o voi ch'avete li 'ntelletti sani,mirate la dottrina che s'asconde,sotto 'l velame de li versi strani,img2poems
10685,li rami schianta abbatte e porta fori,dinanzi polveroso va superbo,e fa fuggir le fiere e li pastori,img2poems
10686,come le rane innanzi a la nimica,biscia per l'acqua si dileguan tutte,fin ch'a la terra ciascuna s'abbica,img2poems
10687,dal volto rimovea quell' aere grasso,menando la sinistra innanzi spesso,e sol di quell' angoscia parea lasso,img2poems
10688,ahi quanto mi parea pien di disdegno,venne a la porta e con una verghetta,l'aperse che non v'ebbe alcun ritegno,img2poems
10689,che giova ne le fata dar di cozzo,cerbero vostro se ben vi ricorda,ne porta ancor pelato il mento e 'l gozzo,img2poems
10690,dentro li 'ntrammo sanz' alcuna guerra,e io ch'avea di riguardar disio,la condizion che tal fortezza serra,img2poems
10691,com' io fui dentro l'occhio intorno invio,e veggio ad ogne man grande campagna,piena di duolo e di tormento rio,img2poems
10692,la gente che per li sepolcri giace,potrebbesi veder,tutt' i coperchi e nessun guardia face,img2poems
10693,suo cimitero da questa parte hanno,con epicuro tutti suoi seguaci,che l'anima col corpo morta fanno,img2poems
10694,allor surse a la vista scoperchiata,un'ombra lungo questa infino al mento,credo che s'era in ginocchie levata,img2poems
10695,dicesti elli ebbe,non viv' elli ancora,non fiere li occhi suoi lo dolce lume,img2poems
10696,ma non cinquanta volte fia raccesa,la faccia de la donna che qui regge,che tu saprai quanto quell' arte pesa,img2poems
10697,el par che voi veggiate se ben odo,dinanzi quel che 'l tempo seco adduce,e nel presente tenete altro modo,img2poems
10698,indi s'ascose e io inver' l'antico,poeta volsi i passi ripensando,a quel parlar che mi parea nemico,img2poems
10699,appresso mosse a man sinistra il piede,lasciammo il muro e gimmo inver' lo mezzo,per un sentier ch'a una valle fiede,img2poems
10700,e quivi per l'orribile soperchio,del puzzo che 'l profondo abisso gitta,ci raccostammo in dietro ad un coperchio,img2poems
10701,morte per forza e ferute dogliose,nel prossimo si danno e nel suo avere,ruine incendi e tollette dannose,img2poems
10702,onde omicide e ciascun che mal fiere,guastatori e predon tutti tormenta,lo giron primo per diverse schiere,img2poems
10703,questo modo di retro par ch'incida,pur lo vinco d'amor che fa natura,onde nel cerchio secondo s'annida,img2poems
10704,non ti rimembra di quelle parole,con le quai la tua etica pertratta,le tre disposizion che 'l ciel non vole,img2poems
10705,dal divino 'ntelletto e da sua arte,e se tu ben la tua fisica note,tu troverai non dopo molte carte,img2poems
10706,era lo loco ov' a scender la riva,venimmo alpestro e per quel che v'er' anco,tal ch'ogne vista ne sarebbe schiva,img2poems
10707,io vidi un'ampia fossa in arco torta,come quella che tutto 'l piano abbraccia,secondo ch'avea detto la mia scorta,img2poems
10708,veggendoci calar ciascun ristette,e de la schiera tre si dipartiro,con archi e asticciuole prima elette,img2poems
10709,or ci movemmo con la scorta fida,lungo la proda del bollor vermiglio,dove i bolliti facieno alte strida,img2poems
10710,poi vidi gente che di fuor del rio,tenean la testa e ancor tutto 'l casso,e di costoro assai riconobb' io,img2poems
10711,la divina giustizia di qua punge,quell' attila che fu flagello in terra,e pirro e sesto e in etterno munge,img2poems
10712,le lagrime che col bollor diserra,a rinier da corneto a rinier pazzo,che fecero a le strade tanta guerra,img2poems
10713,quivi le brutte arpie lor nidi fanno,che cacciar de le strofade i troiani,con tristo annunzio di futuro danno,img2poems
10714,io sentia d'ogne parte trarre guai,e non vedea persona che 'l facesse,per ch'io tutto smarrito m'arrestai,img2poems
10715,come d'un stizzo verde ch'arso sia,da l'un de' capi che da l'altro geme,e cigola per vento che va via,img2poems
10716,non averebbe in te la man distesa,ma la cosa incredibile mi fece,indurlo ad ovra ch'a me stesso pesa,img2poems
10717,la meretrice che mai da l'ospizio,di cesare non torse li occhi putti,morte comune e de le corti vizio,img2poems
10718,l'animo mio per disdegnoso gusto,credendo col morir fuggir disdegno,ingiusto fece me contra me giusto,img2poems
10719,e se di voi alcun nel mondo riede,conforti la memoria mia che giace,ancor del colpo che 'nvidia le diede,img2poems
10720,di dirne come l'anima si lega,in questi nocchi e dinne se tu puoi,s'alcuna mai di tai membra si spiega,img2poems
10721,surge in vermena e in pianta silvestra,l'arpie pascendo poi de le sue foglie,fanno dolore e al dolor fenestra,img2poems
10722,qui le strascineremo e per la mesta,selva saranno i nostri corpi appesi,ciascuno al prun de l'ombra sua molesta,img2poems
10723,noi eravamo ancora al tronco attesi,credendo ch'altro ne volesse dire,quando noi fummo d'un romor sorpresi,img2poems
10724,similemente a colui che venire,sente 'l porco e la caccia a la sua posta,ch'ode le bestie e le frasche stormire,img2poems
10725,di rietro a loro era la selva piena,di nere cagne bramose e correnti,come veltri ch'uscisser di catena,img2poems
10726,presemi allor la mia scorta per mano,e menommi al cespuglio che piangea,per le rotture sanguinenti in vano,img2poems
10727,que' cittadin che poi la rifondarno,sovra 'l cener che d'attila rimase,avrebber fatto lavorare indarno,img2poems
10728,indi venimmo al fine ove si parte,lo secondo giron dal terzo e dove,si vede di giustizia orribil arte,img2poems
10729,a ben manifestar le cose nove,dico che arrivammo ad una landa,che dal suo letto ogne pianta rimove,img2poems
10730,d'anime nude vidi molte gregge,che piangean tutte assai miseramente,e parea posta lor diversa legge,img2poems
10731,sovra tutto 'l sabbion d'un cader lento,piovean di foco dilatate falde,come di neve in alpe sanza vento,img2poems
10732,tale scendeva l'etternale ardore,onde la rena s'accendea com' esca,sotto focile a doppiar lo dolore,img2poems
10733,o s'elli stanchi li altri a muta a muta,in mongibello a la focina negra,chiamando buon vulcano aiuta aiuta,img2poems
10734,dio in disdegno e poco par che 'l pregi,ma com' io dissi lui li suoi dispetti,sono al suo petto assai debiti fregi,img2poems
10735,or mi vien dietro e guarda che non metti,ancor li piedi ne la rena arsiccia,ma sempre al bosco tien li piedi stretti,img2poems
10736,lo fondo suo e ambo le pendici,fatt' era 'n pietra e ' margini dallato,per ch'io m'accorsi che 'l passo era lici,img2poems
10737,e quali padoan lungo la brenta,per difender lor ville e lor castelli,anzi che carentana il caldo senta,img2poems
10738,quando incontrammo d'anime una schiera,che venian lungo l'argine e ciascuna,ci riguardava come suol da sera,img2poems
10739,io non osava scender de la strada,per andar par di lui ma 'l capo chino,tenea com' uom che reverente vada,img2poems
10740,ma quello ingrato popolo maligno,che discese di fiesole ab antico,e tiene ancor del monte e del macigno,img2poems
10741,la tua fortuna tanto onor ti serba,che l'una parte e l'altra avranno fame,di te ma lungi fia dal becco l'erba,img2poems
10742,faccian le bestie fiesolane strame,di lor medesme e non tocchin la pianta,s'alcuna surge ancora in lor letame,img2poems
10743,in cui riviva la sementa santa,di que' roman che vi rimaser quando,fu fatto il nido di malizia tanta,img2poems
10744,m'insegnavate come l'uom s'etterna,e quant' io l'abbia in grado mentr' io vivo,convien che ne la mia lingua si scerna,img2poems
10745,in somma sappi che tutti fur cherci,e litterati grandi e di gran fama,d'un peccato medesmo al mondo lerci,img2poems
10746,priscian sen va con quella turba grama,e francesco d'accorso anche e vedervi,s'avessi avuto di tal tigna brama,img2poems
10747,poi si rivolse e parve di coloro,che corrono a verona il drappo verde,per la campagna e parve di costoro,img2poems
10748,quando tre ombre insieme si partiro,correndo d'una torma che passava,sotto la pioggia de l'aspro martiro,img2poems
10749,e se non fosse il foco che saetta,la natura del loco i' dicerei,che meglio stesse a te che a lor la fretta,img2poems
10750,qual sogliono i campion far nudi e unti,avvisando lor presa e lor vantaggio,prima che sien tra lor battuti e punti,img2poems
10751,questi l'orme di cui pestar mi vedi,tutto che nudo e dipelato vada,fu di grado maggior che tu non credi,img2poems
10752,nepote fu de la buona gualdrada,guido guerra ebbe nome e in sua vita,fece col senno assai e con la spada,img2poems
10753,s'i' fossi stato dal foco coperto,gittato mi sarei tra lor di sotto,e credo che 'l dottor l'avria sofferto,img2poems
10754,ma perch' io mi sarei brusciato e cotto,vinse paura la mia buona voglia,che di loro abbracciar mi facea ghiotto,img2poems
10755,tosto che questo mio segnor mi disse,parole per le quali i' mi pensai,che qual voi siete tal gente venisse,img2poems
10756,di vostra terra sono e sempre mai,l'ovra di voi e li onorati nomi,con affezion ritrassi e ascoltai,img2poems
10757,lascio lo fele e vo per dolci pomi,promessi a me per lo verace duca,ma 'nfino al centro pria convien ch'i' tomi,img2poems
10758,fa che di noi a la gente favelle,indi rupper la rota e a fuggirsi,ali sembiar le gambe loro isnelle,img2poems
10759,come quel fiume c'ha proprio cammino,prima dal monte viso 'nver' levante,da la sinistra costa d'apennino,img2poems
10760,io avea una corda intorno cinta,e con essa pensai alcuna volta,prender la lonza a la pelle dipinta,img2poems
10761,ahi quanto cauti li uomini esser dienno,presso a color che non veggion pur l'ovra,ma per entro i pensier miran col senno,img2poems
10762,ch'i' vidi per quell' aere grosso e scuro,venir notando una figura in suso,maravigliosa ad ogne cor sicuro,img2poems
10763,la faccia sua era faccia d'uom giusto,tanto benigna avea di fuor la pelle,e d'un serpente tutto l'altro fusto,img2poems
10764,due branche avea pilose insin l'ascelle,lo dosso e 'l petto e ambedue le coste,dipinti avea di nodi e di rotelle,img2poems
10765,poi che nel viso a certi li occhi porsi,ne' quali 'l doloroso foco casca,non ne conobbi alcun ma io m'accorsi,img2poems
10766,che dal collo a ciascun pendea una tasca,ch'avea certo colore e certo segno,e quindi par che 'l loro occhio si pasca,img2poems
10767,e com' io riguardando tra lor vegno,in una borsa gialla vidi azzurro,che d'un leone avea faccia e contegno,img2poems
10768,ma esso ch'altra volta mi sovvenne,ad altro forse tosto ch'i' montai,con le braccia m'avvinse e mi sostenne,img2poems
10769,che fu la mia quando vidi ch'i' era,ne l'aere d'ogne parte e vidi spenta,ogne veduta fuor che de la fera,img2poems
10770,ella sen va notando lenta lenta,rota e discende ma non me n'accorgo,se non che al viso e di sotto mi venta,img2poems
10771,discende lasso onde si move isnello,per cento rote e da lunge si pone,dal suo maestro disdegnoso e fello,img2poems
10772,tale imagine quivi facean quelli,e come a tai fortezze da' lor sogli,a la ripa di fuor son ponticelli,img2poems
10773,a la man destra vidi nova pieta,novo tormento e novi frustatori,di che la prima bolgia era repleta,img2poems
10774,come i roman per l'essercito molto,l'anno del giubileo su per lo ponte,hanno a passar la gente modo colto,img2poems
10775,che da l'un lato tutti hanno la fronte,verso 'l castello e vanno a santo pietro,da l'altra sponda vanno verso 'l monte,img2poems
10776,i' fui colui che la ghisolabella,condussi a far la voglia del marchese,come che suoni la sconcia novella,img2poems
10777,lasciolla quivi gravida soletta,tal colpa a tal martiro lui condanna,e anche di medea si fa vendetta,img2poems
10778,al drudo suo quando disse ho io grazie,grandi apo te,: anzi maravigliose,img2poems
10779,o simon mago o miseri seguaci,che le cose di dio che di bontate,deon essere spose e voi rapaci,img2poems
10780,fuor de la bocca a ciascun soperchiava,d'un peccator li piedi e de le gambe,infino al grosso e l'altro dentro stava,img2poems
10781,di sotto al capo mio son li altri tratti,che precedetter me simoneggiando,per le fessure de la pietra piatti,img2poems
10782,e se non fosse ch'ancor lo mi vieta,la reverenza de le somme chiavi,che tu tenesti ne la vita lieta,img2poems
10783,di voi pastor s'accorse il vangelista,quando colei che siede sopra l'acque,puttaneggiar coi regi a lui fu vista,img2poems
10784,quella che con le sette teste nacque,e da le diece corna ebbe argomento,fin che virtute al suo marito piacque,img2poems
10785,ahi costantin di quanto mal fu matre,non la tua conversion ma quella dote,che da te prese il primo ricco patre,img2poems
10786,quivi soavemente spuose il carco,soave per lo scoglio sconcio ed erto,che sarebbe a le capre duro varco,img2poems
10787,e vidi gente per lo vallon tondo,venir tacendo e lagrimando al passo,che fanno le letane in questo mondo,img2poems
10788,se dio ti lasci lettor prender frutto,di tua lezione or pensa per te stesso,com' io potea tener lo viso asciutto,img2poems
10789,drizza la testa drizza e vedi a cui,s'aperse a li occhi d'i teban la terra,per ch'ei gridavan tutti: dove rui,img2poems
10790,ebbe tra ' bianchi marmi la spelonca,per sua dimora onde a guardar le stelle,e 'l mar non li era la veduta tronca,img2poems
10791,non molto ha corso ch'el trova una lama,ne la qual si distende e la 'mpaluda,e suol di state talor essere grama,img2poems
10792,quindi passando la vergine cruda,vide terra nel mezzo del pantano,sanza coltura e d'abitanti nuda,img2poems
10793,li uomini poi che 'ntorno erano sparti,s'accolsero a quel loco ch'era forte,per lo pantan ch'avea da tutte parti,img2poems
10794,vedi guido bonatti vedi asdente,ch'avere inteso al cuoio e a lo spago,ora vorrebbe ma tardi si pente,img2poems
10795,vedi le triste che lasciaron l'ago,la spuola e 'l fuso e fecersi 'ndivine,fecer malie con erbe e con imago,img2poems
10796,restammo per veder l'altra fessura,di malebolge e li altri pianti vani,e vidila mirabilmente oscura,img2poems
10797,chi ribatte da proda e chi da poppa,altri fa remi e altri volge sarte,chi terzeruolo e artimon rintoppa,img2poems
10798,che per veder non indugia 'l partire,e vidi dietro a noi un diavol nero,correndo su per lo scoglio venire,img2poems
10799,e per nulla offension che mi sia fatta,non temer tu ch'i' ho le cose conte,perch' altra volta fui a tal baratta,img2poems
10800,innanzi che l'uncin vostro mi pigli,traggasi avante l'un di voi che m'oda,e poi d'arruncigliarmi si consigli,img2poems
10801,i' m'accostai con tutta la persona,lungo 'l mio duca e non torceva li occhi,da la sembianza lor ch'era non buona,img2poems
10802,cercate 'ntorno le boglienti pane,costor sian salvi infino a l'altro scheggio,che tutto intero va sovra le tane,img2poems
10803,per l'argine sinistro volta dienno,ma prima avea ciascun la lingua stretta,coi denti verso lor duca per cenno,img2poems
10804,corridor vidi per la terra vostra,o aretini e vidi gir gualdane,fedir torneamenti e correr giostra,img2poems
10805,quando con trombe e quando con campane,con tamburi e con cenni di castella,e con cose nostrali e con istrane,img2poems
10806,pur a la pegola era la mia 'ntesa,per veder de la bolgia ogne contegno,e de la gente ch'entro v'era incesa,img2poems
10807,come i dalfini quando fanno segno,a' marinar con l'arco de la schiena,che s'argomentin di campar lor legno,img2poems
10808,poi fui famiglia del buon re tebaldo,quivi mi misi a far baratteria,di ch'io rendo ragione in questo caldo,img2poems
10809,draghignazzo anco i volle dar di piglio,giuso a le gambe onde 'l decurio loro,si volse intorno intorno con mal piglio,img2poems
10810,usa con esso donno michel zanche,di logodoro e a dir di sardigna,le lingue lor non si sentono stanche,img2poems
10811,irato calcabrina de la buffa,volando dietro li tenne invaghito,che quei campasse per aver la zuffa,img2poems
10812,ma l'altro fu bene sparvier grifagno,ad artigliar ben lui e amendue,cadder nel mezzo del bogliente stagno,img2poems
10813,taciti soli sanza compagnia,n'andavam l'un dinanzi e l'altro dopo,come frati minor vanno per via,img2poems
10814,come 'l maestro mio per quel vivagno,portandosene me sovra 'l suo petto,come suo figlio non come compagno,img2poems
10815,oh in etterno faticoso manto,noi ci volgemmo ancor pur a man manca,con loro insieme intenti al tristo pianto,img2poems
10816,ristetti e vidi due mostrar gran fretta,de l'animo col viso d'esser meco,ma tardavali 'l carco e la via stretta,img2poems
10817,frati godenti fummo e bolognesi,io catalano e questi loderingo,nomati e da tua terra insieme presi,img2poems
10818,come suole esser tolto un uom solingo,per conservar sua pace e fummo tali,ch'ancor si pare intorno dal gardingo,img2poems
10819,e a tal modo il socero si stenta,in questa fossa e li altri dal concilio,che fu per li giudei mala sementa,img2poems
10820,allor vid' io maravigliar virgilio,sovra colui ch'era disteso in croce,tanto vilmente ne l'etterno essilio,img2poems
10821,onde noi amendue possiamo uscirci,sanza costrigner de li angeli neri,che vegnan d'esto fondo a dipartirci,img2poems
10822,appresso il duca a gran passi sen gi,turbato un poco d'ira nel sembiante,ond' io da li 'ncarcati mi parti,img2poems
10823,quando la brina in su la terra assempra,l'imagine di sua sorella bianca,ma poco dura a la sua penna tempra,img2poems
10824,lo villanello a cui la roba manca,si leva e guarda e vede la campagna,biancheggiar tutta ond' ei si batte l'anca,img2poems
10825,veggendo 'l mondo aver cangiata faccia,in poco d'ora e prende suo vincastro,e fuor le pecorelle a pascer caccia,img2poems
10826,le braccia aperse dopo alcun consiglio,eletto seco riguardando prima,ben la ruina e diedemi di piglio,img2poems
10827,che l'una costa surge e l'altra scende,noi pur venimmo al fine in su la punta,onde l'ultima pietra si scoscende,img2poems
10828,noi discendemmo il ponte da la testa,dove s'aggiugne con l'ottava ripa,e poi mi fu la bolgia manifesta,img2poems
10829,con serpi le man dietro avean legate,quelle ficcavan per le ren la coda,e 'l capo ed eran dinanzi aggroppate,img2poems
10830,quando si leva che 'ntorno si mira,tutto smarrito de la grande angoscia,ch'elli ha sofferta e guardando sospira,img2poems
10831,apri li orecchi al mio annunzio e odi,pistoia in pria d'i neri si dimagra,poi fiorenza rinova gente e modi,img2poems
10832,maremma non cred' io che tante n'abbia,quante bisce elli avea su per la groppa,infin ove comincia nostra labbia,img2poems
10833,sovra le spalle dietro da la coppa,con l'ali aperte li giacea un draco,e quello affuoca qualunque s'intoppa,img2poems
10834,non va co' suoi fratei per un cammino,per lo furto che frodolente fece,del grande armento ch'elli ebbe a vicino,img2poems
10835,io non li conoscea ma ei seguette,come suol seguitar per alcun caso,che l'un nomar un altro convenette,img2poems
10836,fersi le braccia due di quattro liste,le cosce con le gambe e 'l ventre e 'l casso,divenner membra che non fuor mai viste,img2poems
10837,ogne primaio aspetto ivi era casso,due e nessun l'imagine perversa,parea e tal sen gio con lento passo,img2poems
10838,elli 'l serpente e quei lui riguardava,l'un per la piaga e l'altro per la bocca,fummavan forte e 'l fummo si scontrava,img2poems
10839,insieme si rispuosero a tai norme,che 'l serpente la coda in forca fesse,e 'l feruto ristrinse insieme l'orme,img2poems
10840,mentre che 'l fummo l'uno e l'altro vela,di color novo e genera 'l pel suso,per l'una parte e da l'altra il dipela,img2poems
10841,l'anima ch'era fiera divenuta,suffolando si fugge per la valle,e l'altro dietro a lui parlando sputa,img2poems
10842,e avvegna che li occhi miei confusi,fossero alquanto e l'animo smagato,non poter quei fuggirsi tanto chiusi,img2poems
10843,ch'i' non scorgessi ben puccio sciancato,ed era quel che sol di tre compagni,che venner prima non era mutato,img2poems
10844,tra li ladron trovai cinque cotali,tuoi cittadini onde mi ven vergogna,e tu in grande orranza non ne sali,img2poems
10845,ma se presso al mattin del ver si sogna,tu sentirai di qua da picciol tempo,di quel che prato non ch'altri t'agogna,img2poems
10846,quante 'l villan ch'al poggio si riposa,nel tempo che colui che 'l mondo schiara,la faccia sua a noi tien meno ascosa,img2poems
10847,che non mi facci de l'attender niego,fin che la fiamma cornuta qua vegna,vedi che del disio ver' lei mi piego,img2poems
10848,poi che la fiamma fu venuta quivi,dove parve al mio duca tempo e loco,in questa forma lui parlare audivi,img2poems
10849,quando nel mondo li alti versi scrissi,non vi movete ma l'un di voi dica,dove per lui perduto a morir gissi,img2poems
10850,vincer potero dentro a me l'ardore,ch'i' ebbi a divenir del mondo esperto,e de li vizi umani e del valore,img2poems
10851,ma misi me per l'alto mare aperto,sol con un legno e con quella compagna,picciola da la qual non fui diserto,img2poems
10852,l'un lito e l'altro vidi infin la spagna,fin nel morrocco e l'isola d'i sardi,e l'altre che quel mare intorno bagna,img2poems
10853,o frati dissi che per cento milia,perigli siete giunti a l'occidente,a questa tanto picciola vigilia,img2poems
10854,considerate la vostra semenza,fatti non foste a viver come bruti,ma per seguir virtute e canoscenza,img2poems
10855,e volta nostra poppa nel mattino,de' remi facemmo ali al folle volo,sempre acquistando dal lato mancino,img2poems
10856,cinque volte racceso e tante casso,lo lume era di sotto da la luna,poi che 'ntrati eravam ne l'alto passo,img2poems
10857,perch' io sia giunto forse alquanto tardo,non t'incresca restare a parlar meco,vedi che non incresce a me e ardo,img2poems
10858,se tu pur mo in questo mondo cieco,caduto se' di quella dolce terra,latina ond' io mia colpa tutta reco,img2poems
10859,se non fosse il gran prete a cui mal prenda,che mi rimise ne le prime colpe,e come e quare voglio che m'intenda,img2poems
10860,quando mi vidi giunto in quella parte,di mia etade ove ciascun dovrebbe,calar le vele e raccoglier le sarte,img2poems
10861,e pentuto e confesso mi rendei,ahi miser lasso,e giovato sarebbe,img2poems
10862,francesco venne poi com' io fu' morto,per me ma un d'i neri cherubini,li disse: non portar: non mi far torto,img2poems
10863,oh me dolente,come mi riscossi,quando mi prese dicendomi: forse,img2poems
10864,noi passamm' oltre e io e 'l duca mio,su per lo scoglio infino in su l'altr' arco,che cuopre 'l fosso in che si paga il fio,img2poems
10865,ogne lingua per certo verria meno,per lo nostro sermone e per la mente,c'hanno a tanto comprender poco seno,img2poems
10866,con quella che sentio di colpi doglie,per contastare a ruberto guiscardo,e l'altra il cui ossame ancor s'accoglie,img2poems
10867,e qual forato suo membro e qual mozzo,mostrasse d'aequar sarebbe nulla,il modo de la nona bolgia sozzo,img2poems
10868,tra le gambe pendevan le minugia,la corata pareva e 'l tristo sacco,che merda fa di quel che si trangugia,img2poems
10869,un altro che forata avea la gola,e tronco 'l naso infin sotto le ciglia,e non avea mai ch'una orecchia sola,img2poems
10870,gittati saran fuor di lor vasello,e mazzerati presso a la cattolica,per tradimento d'un tiranno fello,img2poems
10871,quel traditor che vede pur con l'uno,e tien la terra che tale qui meco,vorrebbe di vedere esser digiuno,img2poems
10872,questi scacciato il dubitar sommerse,in cesare affermando che 'l fornito,sempre con danno l'attender sofferse,img2poems
10873,che disse lasso,capo ha cosa fatta,che fu mal seme per la gente tosca,img2poems
10874,qual dolor fora se de li spedali,di valdichiana tra 'l luglio e 'l settembre,e di maremma e di sardigna i mali,img2poems
10875,fossero in una fossa tutti 'nsembre,tal era quivi e tal puzzo n'usciva,qual suol venir de le marcite membre,img2poems
10876,che li animali infino al picciol vermo,cascaron tutti e poi le genti antiche,secondo che i poeti hanno per fermo,img2poems
10877,si ristorar di seme di formiche,ch'era a veder per quella oscura valle,languir li spirti per diverse biche,img2poems
10878,qual sovra 'l ventre e qual sovra le spalle,l'un de l'altro giacea e qual carpone,si trasmutava per lo tristo calle,img2poems
10879,passo passo andavam sanza sermone,guardando e ascoltando li ammalati,che non potean levar le lor persone,img2poems
10880,allor si ruppe lo comun rincalzo,e tremando ciascuno a me si volse,con altri che l'udiron di rimbalzo,img2poems
10881,ditemi chi voi siete e di che genti,la vostra sconcia e fastidiosa pena,di palesarvi a me non vi spaventi,img2poems
10882,volle ch'i' li mostrassi l'arte e solo,perch' io nol feci dedalo mi fece,ardere a tal che l'avea per figliuolo,img2poems
10883,e tra'ne la brigata in che disperse,caccia d'ascian la vigna e la gran fonda,e l'abbagliato suo senno proferse,img2poems
10884,atamante divenne tanto insano,che veggendo la moglie con due figli,andar carcata da ciascuna mano,img2poems
10885,ecuba trista misera e cattiva,poscia che vide polissena morta,e del suo polidoro in su la riva,img2poems
10886,quant' io vidi in due ombre smorte e nude,che mordendo correvan di quel modo,che 'l porco quando del porcil si schiude,img2poems
10887,e poi che i due rabbiosi fuor passati,sovra cu' io avea l'occhio tenuto,rivolsilo a guardar li altri mal nati,img2poems
10888,li ruscelletti che d'i verdi colli,del casentin discendon giuso in arno,faccendo i lor canali freddi e molli,img2poems
10889,ma s'io vedessi qui l'anima trista,di guido o d'alessandro o di lor frate,per fonte branda non darei la vista,img2poems
10890,cercando lui tra questa gente sconcia,con tutto ch'ella volge undici miglia,e men d'un mezzo di traverso non ci ha,img2poems
10891,tu hai l'arsura e 'l capo che ti duole,e per leccar lo specchio di narcisso,non vorresti a 'nvitar molte parole,img2poems
10892,quand' io 'l senti' a me parlar con ira,volsimi verso lui con tal vergogna,ch'ancor per la memoria mi si gira,img2poems
10893,noi demmo il dosso al misero vallone,su per la ripa che 'l cinge dintorno,attraversando sanza alcun sermone,img2poems
10894,sappi che non son torri ma giganti,e son nel pozzo intorno da la ripa,da l'umbilico in giuso tutti quanti,img2poems
10895,torreggiavan di mezza la persona,li orribili giganti cui minaccia,giove del cielo ancora quando tuona,img2poems
10896,la faccia sua mi parea lunga e grossa,come la pina di san pietro a roma,e a sua proporzione eran l'altre ossa,img2poems
10897,a cigner lui qual che fosse 'l maestro,non so io dir ma el tenea soccinto,dinanzi l'altro e dietro il braccio destro,img2poems
10898,per ch'io mi volsi e vidimi davante,e sotto i piedi un lago che per gelo,avea di vetro e non d'acqua sembiante,img2poems
10899,e come a gracidar si sta la rana,col muso fuor de l'acqua quando sogna,di spigolar sovente la villana,img2poems
10900,li occhi lor ch'eran pria pur dentro molli,gocciar su per le labbra e 'l gelo strinse,le lagrime tra essi e riserrolli,img2poems
10901,se vuoi saper chi son cotesti due,la valle onde bisenzo si dichina,del padre loro alberto e di lor fue,img2poems
10902,non quelli a cui fu rotto il petto e l'ombra,con esso un colpo per la man d'artu,non focaccia non questi che m'ingombra,img2poems
10903,e mentre ch'andavamo inver' lo mezzo,al quale ogne gravezza si rauna,e io tremava ne l'etterno rezzo,img2poems
10904,non ti basta sonar con le mascelle,se tu non latri,qual diavol ti tocca,img2poems
10905,che se tu a ragion di lui ti piangi,sappiendo chi voi siete e la sua pecca,nel mondo suso ancora io te ne cangi,img2poems
10906,ma se le mie parole esser dien seme,che frutti infamia al traditor ch'i' rodo,parlar e lagrimar vedrai insieme,img2poems
10907,breve pertugio dentro da la muda,la qual per me ha 'l titol de la fame,e che conviene ancor ch'altrui si chiuda,img2poems
10908,questi pareva a me maestro e donno,cacciando il lupo e ' lupicini al monte,per che i pisan veder lucca non ponno,img2poems
10909,in picciol corso mi parieno stanchi,lo padre e ' figli e con l'agute scane,mi parea lor veder fender li fianchi,img2poems
10910,quando fui desto innanzi la dimane,pianger senti' fra 'l sonno i miei figliuoli,ch'eran con meco e dimandar del pane,img2poems
10911,e io senti' chiavar l'uscio di sotto,a l'orribile torre ond' io guardai,nel viso a' mie' figliuoi sanza far motto,img2poems
10912,come un poco di raggio si fu messo,nel doloroso carcere e io scorsi,per quattro visi il mio aspetto stesso,img2poems
10913,e disser: padre assai ci fia men doglia,se tu mangi di noi: tu ne vestisti,queste misere carni e tu le spoglia,img2poems
10914,che se 'l conte ugolino aveva voce,d'aver tradita te de le castella,non dovei tu i figliuoi porre a tal croce,img2poems
10915,come quando una grossa nebbia spira,o quando l'emisperio nostro annotta,par di lungi un molin che 'l vento gira,img2poems
10916,quando noi fummo fatti tanto avante,ch'al mio maestro piacque di mostrarmi,la creatura ch'ebbe il bel sembiante,img2poems
10917,io non mori' e non rimasi vivo,pensa oggimai per te s'hai fior d'ingegno,qual io divenni d'uno e d'altro privo,img2poems
10918,oh quanto parve a me gran maraviglia,quand' io vidi tre facce a la sua testa,l'una dinanzi e quella era vermiglia,img2poems
10919,sotto ciascuna uscivan due grand' ali,quanto si convenia a tanto uccello,vele di mar non vid' io mai cotali,img2poems
10920,a quel dinanzi il mordere era nulla,verso 'l graffiar che talvolta la schiena,rimanea de la pelle tutta brulla,img2poems
10921,com' a lui piacque il collo li avvinghiai,ed el prese di tempo e loco poste,e quando l'ali fuoro aperte assai,img2poems
10922,d'un ruscelletto che quivi discende,per la buca d'un sasso ch'elli ha roso,col corso ch'elli avvolge e poco pende,img2poems
10923,lo duca e io per quel cammino ascoso,intrammo a ritornar nel chiaro mondo,e sanza cura aver d'alcun riposo,img2poems
10924,seguitando il mio canto con quel suono,di cui le piche misere sentiro,lo colpo tal che disperar perdono,img2poems
10925,i' mi volsi a man destra e puosi mente,a l'altro polo e vidi quattro stelle,non viste mai fuor ch'a la prima gente,img2poems
10926,lunga la barba e di pel bianco mista,portava a' suoi capelli simigliante,de' quai cadeva al petto doppia lista,img2poems
10927,di marzia tua che 'n vista ancor ti priega,o santo petto che per tua la tegni,per lo suo amore adunque a noi ti piega,img2poems
10928,noi andavam per lo solingo piano,com' om che torna a la perduta strada,che 'nfino ad essa li pare ire in vano,img2poems
10929,ambo le mani in su l'erbetta sparte,soavemente 'l mio maestro pose,ond' io che fui accorto di sua arte,img2poems
10930,porsi ver' lui le guance lagrimose,ivi mi fece tutto discoverto,quel color che l'inferno mi nascose,img2poems
10931,venimmo poi in sul lito diserto,che mai non vide navicar sue acque,omo che di tornar sia poscia esperto,img2poems
10932,e la notte che opposita a lui cerchia,uscia di gange fuor con le bilance,che le caggion di man quando soverchia,img2poems
10933,noi eravam lunghesso mare ancora,come gente che pensa a suo cammino,che va col cuore e col corpo dimora,img2poems
10934,lo mio maestro ancor non facea motto,mentre che i primi bianchi apparver ali,allor che ben conobbe il galeotto,img2poems
10935,vedi come l'ha dritte verso 'l cielo,trattando l'aere con l'etterne penne,che non si mutan come mortal pelo,img2poems
10936,ma chinail giuso e quei sen venne a riva,con un vasello snelletto e leggero,tanto che l'acqua nulla ne 'nghiottiva,img2poems
10937,da tutte parti saettava il giorno,lo sol ch'avea con le saette conte,di mezzo 'l ciel cacciato capricorno,img2poems
10938,l'anime che si fuor di me accorte,per lo spirare ch'i' era ancor vivo,maravigliando diventaro smorte,img2poems
10939,e come a messagger che porta ulivo,tragge la gente per udir novelle,e di calcar nessun si mostra schivo,img2poems
10940,ohi ombre vane fuor che ne l'aspetto,tre volte dietro a lei le mani avvinsi,e tante mi tornai con esse al petto,img2poems
10941,di maraviglia credo mi dipinsi,per che l'ombra sorrise e si ritrasse,e io seguendo lei oltre mi pinsi,img2poems
10942,soavemente disse ch'io posasse,allor conobbi chi era e pregai,che per parlarmi un poco s'arrestasse,img2poems
10943,come quando cogliendo biado o loglio,li colombi adunati a la pastura,queti sanza mostrar l'usato orgoglio,img2poems
10944,se cosa appare ond' elli abbian paura,subitamente lasciano star l'esca,perch' assaliti son da maggior cura,img2poems
10945,avvegna che la subitana fuga,dispergesse color per la campagna,rivolti al monte ove ragion ne fruga,img2poems
10946,i' mi ristrinsi a la fida compagna,e come sare' io sanza lui corso,chi m'avria tratto su per la montagna,img2poems
10947,quando li piedi suoi lasciar la fretta,che l'onestade ad ogn' atto dismaga,la mente mia che prima era ristretta,img2poems
10948,io mi volsi dallato con paura,d'essere abbandonato quand' io vidi,solo dinanzi a me la terra oscura,img2poems
10949,e mentre ch'e' tenendo 'l viso basso,essaminava del cammin la mente,e io mirava suso intorno al sasso,img2poems
10950,ancora era quel popol di lontano,i' dico dopo i nostri mille passi,quanto un buon gittator trarria con mano,img2poems
10951,quando si strinser tutti ai duri massi,de l'alta ripa e stetter fermi e stretti,com' a guardar chi va dubbiando stassi,img2poems
10952,come le pecorelle escon del chiuso,a una a due a tre e l'altre stanno,timidette atterrando l'occhio e 'l muso,img2poems
10953,io mi volsi ver' lui e guardail fiso,biondo era e bello e di gentile aspetto,ma l'un de' cigli un colpo avea diviso,img2poems
10954,vadi a mia bella figlia genitrice,de l'onor di cicilia e d'aragona,e dichi 'l vero a lei s'altro si dice,img2poems
10955,poscia ch'io ebbi rotta la persona,di due punte mortali io mi rendei,piangendo a quei che volontier perdona,img2poems
10956,se 'l pastor di cosenza che a la caccia,di me fu messo per clemente allora,avesse in dio ben letta questa faccia,img2poems
10957,l'ossa del corpo mio sarieno ancora,in co del ponte presso a benevento,sotto la guardia de la grave mora,img2poems
10958,vedi oggimai se tu mi puoi far lieto,revelando a la mia buona costanza,come m'hai visto e anco esto divieto,img2poems
10959,maggiore aperta molte volte impruna,con una forcatella di sue spine,l'uom de la villa quando l'uva imbruna,img2poems
10960,dico con l'ale snelle e con le piume,del gran disio di retro a quel condotto,che speranza mi dava e facea lume,img2poems
10961,noi salavam per entro 'l sasso rotto,e d'ogne lato ne stringea lo stremo,e piedi e man volea il suol di sotto,img2poems
10962,li occhi prima drizzai ai bassi liti,poscia li alzai al sole e ammirava,che da sinistra n'eravam feriti,img2poems
10963,vedrai come a costui convien che vada,da l'un quando a colui da l'altro fianco,se lo 'ntelletto tuo ben chiaro bada,img2poems
10964,che 'l mezzo cerchio del moto superno,che si chiama equatore in alcun' arte,e che sempre riman tra 'l sole e 'l verno,img2poems
10965,quiritto se,attendi tu iscorta,o pur lo modo usato t'ha' ripriso,img2poems
10966,prima convien che tanto il ciel m'aggiri,di fuor da essa quanto fece in vita,per ch'io 'ndugiai al fine i buon sospiri,img2poems
10967,li occhi rivolsi al suon di questo motto,e vidile guardar per maraviglia,pur me pur me e 'l lume ch'era rotto,img2poems
10968,ond' io che solo innanzi a li altri parlo,ti priego se mai vedi quel paese,che siede tra romagna e quel di carlo,img2poems
10969,io fui di montefeltro io son bonconte,giovanna o altri non ha di me cura,per ch'io vo tra costor con bassa fronte,img2poems
10970,quivi perdei la vista e la parola,nel nome di maria fini' e quivi,caddi e rimase la mia carne sola,img2poems
10971,ben sai come ne l'aere si raccoglie,quell' umido vapor che in acqua riede,tosto che sale dove 'l freddo il coglie,img2poems
10972,quando si parte il gioco de la zara,colui che perde si riman dolente,repetendo le volte e tristo impara,img2poems
10973,con l'altro se ne va tutta la gente,qual va dinanzi e qual di dietro il prende,e qual dallato li si reca a mente,img2poems
10974,vidi conte orso e l'anima divisa,dal corpo suo per astio e per inveggia,com' e' dicea non per colpa commisa,img2poems
10975,non so se 'ntendi: io dico di beatrice,tu la vedrai di sopra in su la vetta,di questo monte ridere e felice,img2poems
10976,venimmo a lei: o anima lombarda,come ti stavi altera e disdegnosa,e nel mover de li occhi onesta e tarda,img2poems
10977,pur virgilio si trasse a lei pregando,che ne mostrasse la miglior salita,e quella non rispuose al suo dimando,img2poems
10978,ahi serva italia di dolore ostello,nave sanza nocchiere in gran tempesta,non donna di province ma bordello,img2poems
10979,e ora in te non stanno sanza guerra,li vivi tuoi e l'un l'altro si rode,di quei ch'un muro e una fossa serra,img2poems
10980,cerca misera intorno da le prode,le tue marine e poi ti guarda in seno,s'alcuna parte in te di pace gode,img2poems
10981,giusto giudicio da le stelle caggia,sovra 'l tuo sangue e sia novo e aperto,tal che 'l tuo successor temenza n'aggia,img2poems
10982,molti han giustizia in cuore e tardi scocca,per non venir sanza consiglio a l'arco,ma il popol tuo l'ha in sommo de la bocca,img2poems
10983,verso di te che fai tanto sottili,provedimenti ch'a mezzo novembre,non giugne quel che tu d'ottobre fili,img2poems
10984,quante volte del tempo che rimembre,legge moneta officio e costume,hai tu mutato e rinovate membre,img2poems
10985,qual merito o qual grazia mi ti mostra,s'io son d'udir le tue parole degno,dimmi se vien d'inferno e di qual chiostra,img2poems
10986,non per far ma per non fare ho perduto,a veder l'alto sol che tu disiri,e che fu tardi per me conosciuto,img2poems
10987,quivi sto io coi pargoli innocenti,dai denti morsi de la morte avante,che fosser da l'umana colpa essenti,img2poems
10988,poco allungati c'eravam di lici,quand' io m'accorsi che 'l monte era scemo,a guisa che i vallon li sceman quici,img2poems
10989,oro e argento fine cocco e biacca,indaco legno lucido e sereno,fresco smeraldo in l'ora che si fiacca,img2poems
10990,l'altro che ne la vista lui conforta,resse la terra dove l'acqua nasce,che molta in albia e albia in mar ne porta,img2poems
10991,ottacchero ebbe nome e ne le fasce,fu meglio assai che vincislao suo figlio,barbuto cui lussuria e ozio pasce,img2poems
10992,e se re dopo lui fosse rimaso,lo giovanetto che retro a lui siede,ben andava il valor di vaso in vaso,img2poems
10993,che non si puote dir de l'altre rede,iacomo e federigo hanno i reami,del retaggio miglior nessun possiede,img2poems
10994,e che lo novo peregrin d'amore,punge se ode squilla di lontano,che paia il giorno pianger che si more,img2poems
10995,quand' io incominciai a render vano,l'udire e a mirare una de l'alme,surta che l'ascoltar chiedea con mano,img2poems
10996,e l'altre poi dolcemente e devote,seguitar lei per tutto l'inno intero,avendo li occhi a le superne rote,img2poems
10997,verdi come fogliette pur mo nate,erano in veste che da verdi penne,percosse traean dietro e ventilate,img2poems
10998,ond' io che non sapeva per qual calle,mi volsi intorno e stretto m'accostai,tutto gelato a le fidate spalle,img2poems
10999,solo tre passi credo ch'i' scendesse,e fui di sotto e vidi un che mirava,pur me come conoscer mi volesse,img2poems
11000,ver' me si fece e io ver' lui mi fei,giudice nin gentil quanto mi piacque,quando ti vidi non esser tra ' rei,img2poems
11001,per lei assai di lieve si comprende,quanto in femmina foco d'amor dura,se l'occhio o 'l tatto spesso non l'accende,img2poems
11002,da quella parte onde non ha riparo,la picciola vallea era una biscia,forse qual diede ad eva il cibo amaro,img2poems
11003,fui chiamato currado malaspina,non son l'antico ma di lui discesi,a' miei portai l'amor che qui raffina,img2poems
11004,e io vi giuro s'io di sopra vada,che vostra gente onrata non si sfregia,del pregio de la borsa e de la spada,img2poems
11005,di gemme la sua fronte era lucente,poste in figura del freddo animale,che con la coda percuote la gente,img2poems
11006,ne l'ora che comincia i tristi lai,la rondinella presso a la mattina,forse a memoria de' suo' primi guai,img2poems
11007,in sogno mi parea veder sospesa,un'aguglia nel ciel con penne d'oro,con l'ali aperte e a calare intesa,img2poems
11008,poi mi parea che poi rotata un poco,terribil come folgor discendesse,e me rapisse suso infino al foco,img2poems
11009,mi cambia' io e come sanza cura,vide me 'l duca mio su per lo balzo,si mosse e io di rietro inver' l'altura,img2poems
11010,vidi una porta e tre gradi di sotto,per gire ad essa di color diversi,e un portier ch'ancor non facea motto,img2poems
11011,divoto mi gittai a' santi piedi,misericordia chiesi e ch'el m'aprisse,ma tre volte nel petto pria mi diedi,img2poems
11012,cenere o terra che secca si cavi,d'un color fora col suo vestimento,e di sotto da quel trasse due chiavi,img2poems
11013,da pier le tegno e dissemi ch'i' erri,anzi ad aprir ch'a tenerla serrata,pur che la gente a' piedi mi s'atterri,img2poems
11014,e quando fuor ne' cardini distorti,li spigoli di quella regge sacra,che di metallo son sonanti e forti,img2poems
11015,e questo fece i nostri passi scarsi,tanto che pria lo scemo de la luna,rigiunse al letto suo per ricorcarsi,img2poems
11016,e quanto l'occhio mio potea trar d'ale,or dal sinistro e or dal destro fianco,questa cornice mi parea cotale,img2poems
11017,l'angel che venne in terra col decreto,de la molt' anni lagrimata pace,ch'aperse il ciel del suo lungo divieto,img2poems
11018,per ch'i' mi mossi col viso e vedea,di retro da maria da quella costa,onde m'era colui che mi movea,img2poems
11019,i' dico di traiano imperadore,e una vedovella li era al freno,di lagrime atteggiata e di dolore,img2poems
11020,intorno a lui parea calcato e pieno,di cavalieri e l'aguglie ne l'oro,sovr' essi in vista al vento si movieno,img2poems
11021,mentr' io mi dilettava di guardare,l'imagini di tante umilitadi,e per lo fabbro loro a veder care,img2poems
11022,li occhi miei ch'a mirare eran contenti,per veder novitadi ond' e' son vaghi,volgendosi ver' lui non furon lenti,img2poems
11023,o superbi cristian miseri lassi,che de la vista de la mente infermi,fidanza avete ne' retrosi passi,img2poems
11024,non v'accorgete voi che noi siam vermi,nati a formar l'angelica farfalla,che vola a la giustizia sanza schermi,img2poems
11025,come per sostentar solaio o tetto,per mensola talvolta una figura,si vede giugner le ginocchia al petto,img2poems
11026,e come noi lo mal ch'avem sofferto,perdoniamo a ciascuno e tu perdona,benigno e non guardar lo nostro merto,img2poems
11027,disparmente angosciate tutte a tondo,e lasse su per la prima cornice,purgando la caligine del mondo,img2poems
11028,le lor parole che rendero a queste,che dette avea colui cu' io seguiva,non fur da cui venisser manifeste,img2poems
11029,e s'io non fossi impedito dal sasso,che la cervice mia superba doma,onde portar convienmi il viso basso,img2poems
11030,cotesti ch'ancor vive e non si noma,guardere' io per veder s'i' 'l conosco,e per farlo pietoso a questa soma,img2poems
11031,ogn' uomo ebbi in despetto tanto avante,ch'io ne mori' come i sanesi sanno,e sallo in campagnatico ogne fante,img2poems
11032,e qui convien ch'io questo peso porti,per lei tanto che a dio si sodisfaccia,poi ch'io nol fe' tra ' vivi qui tra ' morti,img2poems
11033,e videmi e conobbemi e chiamava,tenendo li occhi con fatica fisi,a me che tutto chin con loro andava,img2poems
11034,di tal superbia qui si paga il fio,e ancor non sarei qui se non fosse,che possendo peccar mi volsi a dio,img2poems
11035,di pari come buoi che vanno a giogo,m'andava io con quell' anima carca,fin che 'l sofferse il dolce pedagogo,img2poems
11036,vedea timbreo vedea pallade e marte,armati ancora intorno al padre loro,mirar le membra d'i giganti sparte,img2poems
11037,mostrava come in rotta si fuggiro,li assiri poi che fu morto oloferne,e anche le reliquie del martiro,img2poems
11038,qual di pennel fu maestro o di stile,che ritraesse l'ombre e ' tratti ch'ivi,mirar farieno uno ingegno sottile,img2poems
11039,morti li morti e i vivi parean vivi,non vide mei di me chi vide il vero,quant' io calcai fin che chinato givi,img2poems
11040,come a man destra per salire al monte,dove siede la chiesa che soggioga,la ben guidata sopra rubaconte,img2poems
11041,si rompe del montar l'ardita foga,per le scalee che si fero ad etade,ch'era sicuro il quaderno e la doga,img2poems
11042,allor fec' io come color che vanno,con cosa in capo non da lor saputa,se non che ' cenni altrui sospecciar fanno,img2poems
11043,e con le dita de la destra scempie,trovai pur sei le lettere che 'ncise,quel da le chiavi a me sovra le tempie,img2poems
11044,noi eravamo al sommo de la scala,dove secondamente si risega,lo monte che salendo altrui dismala,img2poems
11045,tu scaldi il mondo tu sovr' esso luci,s'altra ragione in contrario non ponta,esser dien sempre li tuoi raggi duci,img2poems
11046,lo fren vuol esser del contrario suono,credo che l'udirai per mio avviso,prima che giunghi al passo del perdono,img2poems
11047,di vil ciliccio mi parean coperti,e l'un sofferia l'altro con la spalla,e tutti da la ripa eran sofferti,img2poems
11048,a me pareva andando fare oltraggio,veggendo altrui non essendo veduto,per ch'io mi volsi al mio consiglio saggio,img2poems
11049,eran li cittadin miei presso a colle,in campo giunti co' loro avversari,e io pregava iddio di quel ch'e' volle,img2poems
11050,pace volli con dio in su lo stremo,de la mia vita e ancor non sarebbe,lo mio dover per penitenza scemo,img2poems
11051,io veggio tuo nepote che diventa,cacciator di quei lupi in su la riva,del fiero fiume e tutti li sgomenta,img2poems
11052,sanguinoso esce de la trista selva,lasciala tal che di qui a mille anni,ne lo stato primaio non si rinselva,img2poems
11053,com' a l'annunzio di dogliosi danni,si turba il viso di colui ch'ascolta,da qual che parte il periglio l'assanni,img2poems
11054,lo dir de l'una e de l'altra la vista,mi fer voglioso di saper lor nomi,e dimanda ne fei con prieghi mista,img2poems
11055,quando in bologna un fabbro si ralligna,quando in faenza un bernardin di fosco,verga gentil di picciola gramigna,img2poems
11056,non ti maravigliar s'io piango tosco,quando rimembro con guido da prata,ugolin d'azzo che vivette nosco,img2poems
11057,poi fummo fatti soli procedendo,folgore parve quando l'aere fende,voce che giunse di contra dicendo,img2poems
11058,chiamavi 'l cielo e 'ntorno vi si gira,mostrandovi le sue bellezze etterne,e l'occhio vostro pur a terra mira,img2poems
11059,ond' io levai le mani inver' la cima,de le mie ciglia e fecimi 'l solecchio,che del soverchio visibile lima,img2poems
11060,come quando da l'acqua o da lo specchio,salta lo raggio a l'opposita parte,salendo su per lo modo parecchio,img2poems
11061,lo mio maestro e io soli amendue,suso andavamo e io pensai andando,prode acquistar ne le parole sue,img2poems
11062,ma se l'amor de la spera supprema,torcesse in suso il disiderio vostro,non vi sarebbe al petto quella tema,img2poems
11063,ecco dolenti lo tuo padre e io,ti cercavamo,e come qui si tacque,img2poems
11064,noi andavam per lo vespero attenti,oltre quanto potean li occhi allungarsi,contra i raggi serotini e lucenti,img2poems
11065,io sentia voci e ciascuna pareva,pregar per pace e per misericordia,l'agnel di dio che le peccata leva,img2poems
11066,e se dio m'ha in sua grazia rinchiuso,tanto che vuol ch'i' veggia la sua corte,per modo tutto fuor del moderno uso,img2poems
11067,non mi celar chi fosti anzi la morte,ma dilmi e dimmi s'i' vo bene al varco,e tue parole fier le nostre scorte,img2poems
11068,voi che vivete ogne cagion recate,pur suso al cielo pur come se tutto,movesse seco di necessitate,img2poems
11069,e libero voler che se fatica,ne le prime battaglie col ciel dura,poi vince tutto se ben si notrica,img2poems
11070,a maggior forza e a miglior natura,liberi soggiacete e quella cria,la mente in voi che 'l ciel non ha in sua cura,img2poems
11071,esce di mano a lui che la vagheggia,prima che sia a guisa di fanciulla,che piangendo e ridendo pargoleggia,img2poems
11072,di picciol bene in pria sente sapore,quivi s'inganna e dietro ad esso corre,se guida o fren non torce suo amore,img2poems
11073,onde convenne legge per fren porre,convenne rege aver che discernesse,de la vera cittade almen la torre,img2poems
11074,soleva roma che 'l buon mondo feo,due soli aver che l'una e l'altra strada,facean vedere e del mondo e di deo,img2poems
11075,in sul paese ch'adice e po riga,solea valore e cortesia trovarsi,prima che federigo avesse briga,img2poems
11076,currado da palazzo e 'l buon gherardo,e guido da castel che mei si noma,francescamente il semplice lombardo,img2poems
11077,ricorditi lettor se mai ne l'alpe,ti colse nebbia per la qual vedessi,non altrimenti che per pelle talpe,img2poems
11078,come quando i vapori umidi e spessi,a diradar cominciansi la spera,del sol debilemente entra per essi,img2poems
11079,poi piovve dentro a l'alta fantasia,un crucifisso dispettoso e fero,ne la sua vista e cotal si moria,img2poems
11080,come si frange il sonno ove di butto,nova luce percuote il viso chiuso,che fratto guizza pria che muoia tutto,img2poems
11081,e fece la mia voglia tanto pronta,di riguardar chi era che parlava,che mai non posa se non si raffronta,img2poems
11082,e io attesi un poco s'io udissi,alcuna cosa nel novo girone,poi mi volsi al maestro mio e dissi,img2poems
11083,quinci comprender puoi ch'esser convene,amor sementa in voi d'ogne virtute,e d'ogne operazion che merta pene,img2poems
11084,ciascun confusamente un bene apprende,nel qual si queti l'animo e disira,per che di giugner lui ciascun contende,img2poems
11085,se lento amore a lui veder vi tira,o a lui acquistar questa cornice,dopo giusto penter ve ne martira,img2poems
11086,l'amor ch'ad esso troppo s'abbandona,di sovr' a noi si piange per tre cerchi,ma come tripartito si ragiona,img2poems
11087,posto avea fine al suo ragionamento,l'alto dottore e attento guardava,ne la mia vista s'io parea contento,img2poems
11088,ma quel padre verace che s'accorse,del timido voler che non s'apriva,parlando di parlare ardir mi porse,img2poems
11089,e correa contro 'l ciel per quelle strade,che 'l sole infiamma allor che quel da roma,tra ' sardi e ' corsi il vede quando cade,img2poems
11090,per ch'io che la ragione aperta e piana,sovra le mie quistioni avea ricolta,stava com' om che sonnolento vana,img2poems
11091,cotal per quel giron suo passo falca,per quel ch'io vidi di color venendo,cui buon volere e giusto amor cavalca,img2poems
11092,io fui abate in san zeno a verona,sotto lo 'mperio del buon barbarossa,di cui dolente ancor milan ragiona,img2poems
11093,ancor non era sua bocca richiusa,quand' una donna apparve santa e presta,lunghesso me per far colei confusa,img2poems
11094,bastiti e batti a terra le calcagne,li occhi rivolgi al logoro che gira,lo rege etterno con le rote magne,img2poems
11095,tal mi fec' io e tal quanto si fende,la roccia per dar via a chi va suso,n'andai infin dove 'l cerchiar si prende,img2poems
11096,com' io nel quinto giro fui dischiuso,vidi gente per esso che piangea,giacendo a terra tutta volta in giuso,img2poems
11097,poi ch'io potei di me fare a mio senno,trassimi sovra quella creatura,le cui parole pria notar mi fenno,img2poems
11098,fino a quel punto misera e partita,da dio anima fui del tutto avara,or come vedi qui ne son punita,img2poems
11099,ne' piedi e ne le man legati e presi,e quanto fia piacer del giusto sire,tanto staremo immobili e distesi,img2poems
11100,io m'era inginocchiato e volea dire,ma com' io cominciai ed el s'accorse,solo ascoltando del mio reverire,img2poems
11101,contra miglior voler voler mal pugna,onde contra 'l piacer mio per piacerli,trassi de l'acqua non sazia la spugna,img2poems
11102,mossimi e 'l duca mio si mosse per li,luoghi spediti pur lungo la roccia,come si va per muro stretto a' merli,img2poems
11103,noi andavam con passi lenti e scarsi,e io attento a l'ombre ch'i' sentia,pietosamente piangere e lagnarsi,img2poems
11104,ma se doagio lilla guanto e bruggia,potesser tosto ne saria vendetta,e io la cheggio a lui che tutto giuggia,img2poems
11105,figliuol fu' io d'un beccaio di parigi,quando li regi antichi venner meno,tutti fuor ch'un renduto in panni bigi,img2poems
11106,ch'a la corona vedova promossa,la testa di mio figlio fu dal quale,cominciar di costor le sacrate ossa,img2poems
11107,mentre che la gran dota provenzale,al sangue mio non tolse la vergogna,poco valea ma pur non facea male,img2poems
11108,veggiolo un'altra volta esser deriso,veggio rinovellar l'aceto e 'l fiele,e tra vivi ladroni esser anciso,img2poems
11109,talor parla l'uno alto e l'altro basso,secondo l'affezion ch'ad ir ci sprona,ora a maggiore e ora a minor passo,img2poems
11110,quand' io senti' come cosa che cada,tremar lo monte onde mi prese un gelo,qual prender suol colui ch'a morte vada,img2poems
11111,mi travagliava e pungeami la fretta,per la 'mpacciata via dietro al mio duca,e condoleami a la giusta vendetta,img2poems
11112,de la mondizia sol voler fa prova,che tutto libero a mutar convento,l'alma sorprende e di voler le giova,img2poems
11113,prima vuol ben ma non lascia il talento,che divina giustizia contra voglia,come fu al peccar pone al tormento,img2poems
11114,or son io d'una parte e d'altra preso,l'una mi fa tacer l'altra scongiura,ch'io dica ond' io sospiro e sono inteso,img2poems
11115,se cagion altra al mio rider credesti,lasciala per non vera ed esser credi,quelle parole che di lui dicesti,img2poems
11116,la tua dimanda tuo creder m'avvera,esser ch'i' fossi avaro in l'altra vita,forse per quella cerchia dov' io era,img2poems
11117,or sappi ch'avarizia fu partita,troppo da me e questa dismisura,migliaia di lunari hanno punita,img2poems
11118,quanti risurgeran coi crini scemi,per ignoranza che di questa pecca,toglie 'l penter vivendo e ne li stremi,img2poems
11119,e sappie che la colpa che rimbecca,per dritta opposizione alcun peccato,con esso insieme qui suo verde secca,img2poems
11120,e la parola tua sopra toccata,si consonava a' nuovi predicanti,ond' io a visitarli presi usata,img2poems
11121,vennermi poi parendo tanto santi,che quando domizian li perseguette,sanza mio lagrimar non fur lor pianti,img2poems
11122,e pria ch'io conducessi i greci a' fiumi,di tebe poetando ebb' io battesmo,ma per paura chiuso cristian fu'mi,img2poems
11123,tu dunque che levato hai il coperchio,che m'ascondeva quanto bene io dico,mentre che del salire avem soverchio,img2poems
11124,elli givan dinanzi e io soletto,di retro e ascoltava i lor sermoni,ch'a poetar mi davano intelletto,img2poems
11125,ma tosto ruppe le dolci ragioni,un alber che trovammo in mezza strada,con pomi a odorar soavi e buoni,img2poems
11126,dal lato onde 'l cammin nostro era chiuso,cadea de l'alta roccia un liquor chiaro,e si spandeva per le foglie suso,img2poems
11127,ne li occhi era ciascuna oscura e cava,palida ne la faccia e tanto scema,che da l'ossa la pelle s'informava,img2poems
11128,questa favilla tutta mi raccese,mia conoscenza a la cangiata labbia,e ravvisai la faccia di forese,img2poems
11129,di bere e di mangiar n'accende cura,l'odor ch'esce del pomo e de lo sprazzo,che si distende su per sua verdura,img2poems
11130,e non pur una volta questo spazzo,girando si rinfresca nostra pena,io dico pena e dovria dir sollazzo,img2poems
11131,con suoi prieghi devoti e con sospiri,tratto m'ha de la costa ove s'aspetta,e liberato m'ha de li altri giri,img2poems
11132,quai barbare fuor mai quai saracine,cui bisognasse per farle ir coperte,o spiritali o altre discipline,img2poems
11133,e l'ombre che parean cose rimorte,per le fosse de li occhi ammirazione,traean di me di mio vivere accorte,img2poems
11134,ebbe la santa chiesa in le sue braccia,dal torso fu e purga per digiuno,l'anguille di bolsena e la vernaccia,img2poems
11135,tu te n'andrai con questo antivedere,se nel mio mormorar prendesti errore,dichiareranti ancor le cose vere,img2poems
11136,io veggio ben come le vostre penne,di retro al dittator sen vanno strette,che de le nostre certo non avvenne,img2poems
11137,qual esce alcuna volta di gualoppo,lo cavalier di schiera che cavalchi,e va per farsi onor del primo intoppo,img2poems
11138,e quando innanzi a noi intrato fue,che li occhi miei si fero a lui seguaci,come la mente a le parole sue,img2poems
11139,vidi gente sott' esso alzar le mani,e gridar non so che verso le fronde,quasi bramosi fantolini e vani,img2poems
11140,che pregano e 'l pregato non risponde,ma per fare esser ben la voglia acuta,tien alto lor disio e nol nasconde,img2poems
11141,l'aspetto suo m'avea la vista tolta,per ch'io mi volsi dietro a' miei dottori,com' om che va secondo ch'elli ascolta,img2poems
11142,e quale annunziatrice de li albori,l'aura di maggio movesi e olezza,tutta impregnata da l'erba e da' fiori,img2poems
11143,per che come fa l'uom che non s'affigge,ma vassi a la via sua che che li appaia,se di bisogno stimolo il trafigge,img2poems
11144,tal era io con voglia accesa e spenta,di dimandar venendo infino a l'atto,che fa colui ch'a dicer s'argomenta,img2poems
11145,sangue perfetto che poi non si beve,da l'assetate vene e si rimane,quasi alimento che di mensa leve,img2poems
11146,prende nel core a tutte membra umane,virtute informativa come quello,ch'a farsi quelle per le vene vane,img2poems
11147,ivi s'accoglie l'uno e l'altro insieme,l'un disposto a patire e l'altro a fare,per lo perfetto loco onde si preme,img2poems
11148,quindi parliamo e quindi ridiam noi,quindi facciam le lagrime e ' sospiri,che per lo monte aver sentiti puoi,img2poems
11149,quivi la ripa fiamma in fuor balestra,e la cornice spira fiato in suso,che la reflette e via da lei sequestra,img2poems
11150,e vidi spirti per la fiamma andando,per ch'io guardava a loro e a' miei passi,compartendo la vista a quando a quando,img2poems
11151,indi al cantar tornavano indi donne,gridavano e mariti che fuor casti,come virtute e matrimonio imponne,img2poems
11152,e questo modo credo che lor basti,per tutto il tempo che 'l foco li abbruscia,con tal cura conviene e con tai pasti,img2poems
11153,poi come grue ch'a le montagne rife,volasser parte e parte inver' l'arene,queste del gel quelle del sole schife,img2poems
11154,e raccostansi a me come davanti,essi medesmi che m'avean pregato,attenti ad ascoltar ne' lor sembianti,img2poems
11155,non altrimenti stupido si turba,lo montanaro e rimirando ammuta,quando rozzo e salvatico s'inurba,img2poems
11156,che ciascun' ombra fece in sua paruta,ma poi che furon di stupore scarche,lo qual ne li alti cuor tosto s'attuta,img2poems
11157,quali ne la tristizia di ligurgo,si fer due figli a riveder la madre,tal mi fec' io ma non a tanto insurgo,img2poems
11158,poi che di riguardar pasciuto fui,tutto m'offersi pronto al suo servigio,con l'affermar che fa credere altrui,img2poems
11159,poi forse per dar luogo altrui secondo,che presso avea disparve per lo foco,come per l'acqua il pesce andando al fondo,img2poems
11160,ieu sui arnaut que plor e vau cantan,consiros vei la passada folor,e vei jausen lo joi qu'esper denan,img2poems
11161,ara vos prec per aquella valor,que vos guida al som de l'escalina,sovenha vos a temps de ma dolor,img2poems
11162,credi per certo che se dentro a l'alvo,di questa fiamma stessi ben mille anni,non ti potrebbe far d'un capel calvo,img2poems
11163,e se tu forse credi ch'io t'inganni,fatti ver' lei e fatti far credenza,con le tue mani al lembo d'i tuoi panni,img2poems
11164,poi dentro al foco innanzi mi si mise,pregando stazio che venisse retro,che pria per lunga strada ci divise,img2poems
11165,e di pochi scaglion levammo i saggi,che 'l sol corcar per l'ombra che si spense,sentimmo dietro e io e li miei saggi,img2poems
11166,e pria che 'n tutte le sue parti immense,fosse orizzonte fatto d'uno aspetto,e notte avesse tutte sue dispense,img2poems
11167,quali si stanno ruminando manse,le capre state rapide e proterve,sovra le cime avante che sien pranse,img2poems
11168,tali eravamo tutti e tre allotta,io come capra ed ei come pastori,fasciati quinci e quindi d'alta grotta,img2poems
11169,giovane e bella in sogno mi parea,donna vedere andar per una landa,cogliendo fiori e cantando dicea,img2poems
11170,per piacermi a lo specchio qui m'addorno,ma mia suora rachel mai non si smaga,dal suo miraglio e siede tutto giorno,img2poems
11171,tratto t'ho qui con ingegno e con arte,lo tuo piacere omai prendi per duce,fuor se' de l'erte vie fuor se' de l'arte,img2poems
11172,mentre che vegnan lieti li occhi belli,che lagrimando a te venir mi fenno,seder ti puoi e puoi andar tra elli,img2poems
11173,per cui le fronde tremolando pronte,tutte quante piegavano a la parte,u' la prim' ombra gitta il santo monte,img2poems
11174,ma con piena letizia l'ore prime,cantando ricevieno intra le foglie,che tenevan bordone a le sue rime,img2poems
11175,una donna soletta che si gia,e cantando e scegliendo fior da fiore,ond' era pinta tutta la sua via,img2poems
11176,tu mi fai rimembrar dove e qual era,proserpina nel tempo che perdette,la madre lei ed ella primavera,img2poems
11177,volsesi in su i vermigli e in su i gialli,fioretti verso me non altrimenti,che vergine che li occhi onesti avvalli,img2poems
11178,non credo che splendesse tanto lume,sotto le ciglia a venere trafitta,dal figlio fuor di tutto suo costume,img2poems
11179,maravigliando tienvi alcun sospetto,ma luce rende il salmo delectasti,che puote disnebbiar vostro intelletto,img2poems
11180,e la percossa pianta tanto puote,che de la sua virtute l'aura impregna,e quella poi girando intorno scuote,img2poems
11181,l'acqua che vedi non surge di vena,che ristori vapor che gel converta,come fiume ch'acquista e perde lena,img2poems
11182,ma esce di fontana salda e certa,che tanto dal voler di dio riprende,quant' ella versa da due parti aperta,img2poems
11183,allor si mosse contra 'l fiume andando,su per la riva e io pari di lei,picciol passo con picciol seguitando,img2poems
11184,non eran cento tra ' suoi passi e ' miei,quando le ripe igualmente dier volta,per modo ch'a levante mi rendei,img2poems
11185,io mi rivolsi d'ammirazion pieno,al buon virgilio ed esso mi rispuose,con vista carca di stupor non meno,img2poems
11186,quand' io da la mia riva ebbi tal posta,che solo il fiume mi facea distante,per veder meglio ai passi diedi sosta,img2poems
11187,questi ostendali in dietro eran maggiori,che la mia vista e quanto a mio avviso,diece passi distavan quei di fori,img2poems
11188,poscia che i fiori e l'altre fresche erbette,a rimpetto di me da l'altra sponda,libere fuor da quelle genti elette,img2poems
11189,ognuno era pennuto di sei ali,le penne piene d'occhi e li occhi d'argo,se fosser vivi sarebber cotali,img2poems
11190,tanto salivan che non eran viste,le membra d'oro avea quant' era uccello,e bianche l'altre di vermiglio miste,img2poems
11191,tre donne in giro da la destra rota,venian danzando l'una tanto rossa,ch'a pena fora dentro al foco nota,img2poems
11192,da la sinistra quattro facean festa,in porpore vestite dietro al modo,d'una di lor ch'avea tre occhi in testa,img2poems
11193,appresso tutto il pertrattato nodo,vidi due vecchi in abito dispari,ma pari in atto e onesto e sodo,img2poems
11194,poi vidi quattro in umile paruta,e di retro da tutti un vecchio solo,venir dormendo con la faccia arguta,img2poems
11195,anzi di rose e d'altri fior vermigli,giurato avria poco lontano aspetto,che tutti ardesser di sopra da' cigli,img2poems
11196,quali i beati al novissimo bando,surgeran presti ognun di sua caverna,la revestita voce alleluiando,img2poems
11197,cotali in su la divina basterna,si levar cento ad vocem tanti senis,ministri e messaggier di vita etterna,img2poems
11198,sovra candido vel cinta d'uliva,donna m'apparve sotto verde manto,vestita di color di fiamma viva,img2poems
11199,quasi ammiraglio che in poppa e in prora,viene a veder la gente che ministra,per li altri legni e a ben far l'incora,img2poems
11200,vidi la donna che pria m'appario,velata sotto l'angelica festa,drizzar li occhi ver' me di qua dal rio,img2poems
11201,tutto che 'l vel che le scendea di testa,cerchiato de le fronde di minerva,non la lasciasse parer manifesta,img2poems
11202,non pur per ovra de le rote magne,che drizzan ciascun seme ad alcun fine,secondo che le stelle son compagne,img2poems
11203,e volse i passi suoi per via non vera,imagini di ben seguendo false,che nulla promession rendono intera,img2poems
11204,come balestro frange quando scocca,da troppa tesa la sua corda e l'arco,e con men foga l'asta il segno tocca,img2poems
11205,e quali agevolezze o quali avanzi,ne la fronte de li altri si mostraro,per che dovessi lor passeggiare anzi,img2poems
11206,dopo la tratta d'un sospiro amaro,a pena ebbi la voce che rispuose,e le labbra a fatica la formaro,img2poems
11207,novo augelletto due o tre aspetta,ma dinanzi da li occhi d'i pennuti,rete si spiega indarno o si saetta,img2poems
11208,con men di resistenza si dibarba,robusto cerro o vero al nostral vento,o vero a quel de la terra di iarba,img2poems
11209,ch'io non levai al suo comando il mento,e quando per la barba il viso chiese,ben conobbi il velen de l'argomento,img2poems
11210,tanta riconoscenza il cor mi morse,ch'io caddi vinto e quale allora femmi,salsi colei che la cagion mi porse,img2poems
11211,tratto m'avea nel fiume infin la gola,e tirandosi me dietro sen giva,sovresso l'acqua lieve come scola,img2poems
11212,la bella donna ne le braccia aprissi,abbracciommi la testa e mi sommerse,ove convenne ch'io l'acqua inghiottissi,img2poems
11213,indi mi tolse e bagnato m'offerse,dentro a la danza de le quattro belle,e ciascuna del braccio mi coperse,img2poems
11214,come in lo specchio il sol non altrimenti,la doppia fiera dentro vi raggiava,or con altri or con altri reggimenti,img2poems
11215,tant' eran li occhi miei fissi e attenti,a disbramarsi la decenne sete,che li altri sensi m'eran tutti spenti,img2poems
11216,quella milizia del celeste regno,che procedeva tutta trapassonne,pria che piegasse il carro il primo legno,img2poems
11217,turgide fansi e poi si rinovella,di suo color ciascuna pria che 'l sole,giunga li suoi corsier sotto altra stella,img2poems
11218,come pintor che con essempro pinga,disegnerei com' io m'addormentai,ma qual vuol sia che l'assonnar ben finga,img2poems
11219,pietro e giovanni e iacopo condotti,e vinti ritornaro a la parola,da la qual furon maggior sonni rotti,img2poems
11220,tal torna' io e vidi quella pia,sovra me starsi che conducitrice,fu de' miei passi lungo 'l fiume pria,img2poems
11221,ma riprendendo lei di laide colpe,la donna mia la volse in tanta futa,quanto sofferser l'ossa sanza polpe,img2poems
11222,quel che rimase come da gramigna,vivace terra da la piuma offerta,forse con intenzion sana e benigna,img2poems
11223,le prime eran cornute come bue,ma le quattro un sol corno avean per fronte,simile mostro visto ancor non fue,img2poems
11224,sicura quasi rocca in alto monte,seder sovresso una puttana sciolta,m'apparve con le ciglia intorno pronte,img2poems
11225,poi di sospetto pieno e d'ira crudo,disciolse il mostro e trassel per la selva,tanto che sol di lei mi fece scudo,img2poems
11226,ma poi che l'altre vergini dier loco,a lei di dir levata dritta in pe,rispuose colorata come foco,img2poems
11227,come a color che troppo reverenti,dinanzi a suo maggior parlando sono,che non traggon la voce viva ai denti,img2poems
11228,e forse che la mia narrazion buia,qual temi e sfinge men ti persuade,perch' a lor modo lo 'ntelletto attuia,img2poems
11229,ma tosto fier li fatti le naiade,che solveranno questo enigma forte,sanza danno di pecore o di biade,img2poems
11230,e se stati non fossero acqua d'elsa,li pensier vani intorno a la tua mente,e 'l piacer loro un piramo a la gelsa,img2poems
11231,per tante circostanze solamente,la giustizia di dio ne l'interdetto,conosceresti a l'arbor moralmente,img2poems
11232,voglio anco e se non scritto almen dipinto,che 'l te ne porti dentro a te per quello,che si reca il bordon di palma cinto,img2poems
11233,veramente oramai saranno nude,le mie parole quanto converrassi,quelle scovrire a la tua vista rude,img2poems
11234,le sette donne al fin d'un'ombra smorta,qual sotto foglie verdi e rami nigri,sovra suoi freddi rivi l'alpe porta,img2poems
11235,matelda che 'l ti dica,e qui rispuose,come fa chi da colpa si dislega,img2poems
11236,surge ai mortali per diverse foci,la lucerna del mondo ma da quella,che quattro cerchi giugne con tre croci,img2poems
11237,s'i' era sol di me quel che creasti,novellamente amor che 'l ciel governi,tu 'l sai che col tuo lume mi levasti,img2poems
11238,parvemi tanto allor del cielo acceso,de la fiamma del sol che pioggia o fiume,lago non fece alcun tanto disteso,img2poems
11239,onde si muovono a diversi porti,per lo gran mar de l'essere e ciascuna,con istinto a lei dato che la porti,img2poems
11240,o voi che siete in piccioletta barca,desiderosi d'ascoltar seguiti,dietro al mio legno che cantando varca,img2poems
11241,voialtri pochi che drizzaste il collo,per tempo al pan de li angeli del quale,vivesi qui ma non sen vien satollo,img2poems
11242,metter potete ben per l'alto sale,vostro navigio servando mio solco,dinanzi a l'acqua che ritorna equale,img2poems
11243,beatrice in suso e io in lei guardava,e forse in tanto in quanto un quadrel posa,e vola e da la noce si dischiava,img2poems
11244,parev' a me che nube ne coprisse,lucida spessa solida e pulita,quasi adamante che lo sol ferisse,img2poems
11245,s'io era corpo e qui non si concepe,com' una dimensione altra patio,ch'esser convien se corpo in corpo repe,img2poems
11246,certo non ti dovrien punger li strali,d'ammirazione omai poi dietro ai sensi,vedi che la ragione ha corte l'ali,img2poems
11247,la spera ottava vi dimostra molti,lumi li quali e nel quale e nel quanto,notar si posson di diversi volti,img2poems
11248,se 'l primo fosse fora manifesto,ne l'eclissi del sol per trasparere,lo lume come in altro raro ingesto,img2poems
11249,rivolto ad essi fa che dopo il dosso,ti stea un lume che i tre specchi accenda,e torni a te da tutti ripercosso,img2poems
11250,or come ai colpi de li caldi rai,de la neve riman nudo il suggetto,e dal colore e dal freddo primai,img2poems
11251,dentro dal ciel de la divina pace,si gira un corpo ne la cui virtute,l'esser di tutto suo contento giace,img2poems
11252,lo ciel seguente c'ha tante vedute,quell' esser parte per diverse essenze,da lui distratte e da lui contenute,img2poems
11253,e 'l ciel cui tanti lumi fanno bello,de la mente profonda che lui volve,prende l'image e fassene suggello,img2poems
11254,e come l'alma dentro a vostra polve,per differenti membra e conformate,a diverse potenze si risolve,img2poems
11255,e nulla vidi e ritorsili avanti,dritti nel lume de la dolce guida,che sorridendo ardea ne li occhi santi,img2poems
11256,li nostri affetti che solo infiammati,son nel piacer de lo spirito santo,letizian del suo ordine formati,img2poems
11257,con quelle altr' ombre pria sorrise un poco,da indi mi rispuose tanto lieta,ch'arder parea d'amor nel primo foco,img2poems
11258,dal mondo per seguirla giovinetta,fuggi'mi e nel suo abito mi chiusi,e promisi la via de la sua setta,img2poems
11259,e quest' altro splendor che ti si mostra,da la mia destra parte e che s'accende,di tutto il lume de la spera nostra,img2poems
11260,la vista mia che tanto lei seguio,quanto possibil fu poi che la perse,volsesi al segno di maggior disio,img2poems
11261,intra due cibi distanti e moventi,d'un modo prima si morria di fame,che liber' omo l'un recasse ai denti,img2poems
11262,per questo la scrittura condescende,a vostra facultate e piedi e mano,attribuisce a dio e altro intende,img2poems
11263,dice che l'alma a la sua stella riede,credendo quella quindi esser decisa,quando natura per forma la diede,img2poems
11264,s'elli intende tornare a queste ruote,l'onor de la influenza e 'l biasmo forse,in alcun vero suo arco percuote,img2poems
11265,se fosse stato lor volere intero,come tenne lorenzo in su la grada,e fece muzio a la sua man severo,img2poems
11266,ma or ti s'attraversa un altro passo,dinanzi a li occhi tal che per te stesso,non usciresti: pria saresti lasso,img2poems
11267,posasi in esso come fera in lustra,tosto che giunto l'ha e giugner puollo,se non ciascun disio sarebbe frustra,img2poems
11268,dunque che render puossi per ristoro,se credi bene usar quel c'hai offerto,di maltolletto vuo' far buon lavoro,img2poems
11269,ma non trasmuti carco a la sua spalla,per suo arbitrio alcun sanza la volta,e de la chiave bianca e de la gialla,img2poems
11270,avete il novo e 'l vecchio testamento,e 'l pastor de la chiesa che vi guida,questo vi basti a vostro salvamento,img2poems
11271,non fate com' agnel che lascia il latte,de la sua madre e semplice e lascivo,seco medesmo a suo piacer combatte,img2poems
11272,tosto che con la chiesa mossi i piedi,a dio per grazia piacque di spirarmi,l'alto lavoro e tutto 'n lui mi diedi,img2poems
11273,or qui a la question prima s'appunta,la mia risposta ma sua condizione,mi stringe a seguitare alcuna giunta,img2poems
11274,tu sai ch'el fece in alba sua dimora,per trecento anni e oltre infino al fine,che i tre a' tre pugnar per lui ancora,img2poems
11275,onde torquato e quinzio che dal cirro,negletto fu nomato i deci e ' fabi,ebber la fama che volontier mirro,img2poems
11276,poi presso al tempo che tutto 'l ciel volle,redur lo mondo a suo modo sereno,cesare per voler di roma il tolle,img2poems
11277,da indi scese folgorando a iuba,onde si volse nel vostro occidente,ove sentia la pompeana tuba,img2poems
11278,piangene ancor la trista cleopatra,che fuggendoli innanzi dal colubro,la morte prese subitana e atra,img2poems
11279,con costui corse infino al lito rubro,con costui puose il mondo in tanta pace,che fu serrato a giano il suo delubro,img2poems
11280,diventa in apparenza poco e scuro,se in mano al terzo cesare si mira,con occhio chiaro e con affetto puro,img2poems
11281,e quando il dente longobardo morse,la santa chiesa sotto le sue ali,carlo magno vincendo la soccorse,img2poems
11282,omai puoi giudicar di quei cotali,ch'io accusai di sopra e di lor falli,che son cagion di tutti vostri mali,img2poems
11283,e dentro a la presente margarita,luce la luce di romeo di cui,fu l'ovra grande e bella mal gradita,img2poems
11284,indi partissi povero e vetusto,e se 'l mondo sapesse il cor ch'elli ebbe,mendicando sua vita a frusto a frusto,img2poems
11285,ma quella reverenza che s'indonna,di tutto me pur per be e per ice,mi richinava come l'uom ch'assonna,img2poems
11286,or drizza il viso a quel ch'or si ragiona,questa natura al suo fattore unita,qual fu creata fu sincera e buona,img2poems
11287,ma io veggi' or la tua mente ristretta,di pensiero in pensier dentro ad un nodo,del qual con gran disio solver s'aspetta,img2poems
11288,ficca mo l'occhio per entro l'abisso,de l'etterno consiglio quanto puoi,al mio parlar distrettamente fisso,img2poems
11289,dunque a dio convenia con le vie sue,riparar l'omo a sua intera vita,dico con l'una o ver con amendue,img2poems
11290,tu dici: io veggio l'acqua io veggio il foco,l'aere e la terra e tutte lor misture,venire a corruzione e durar poco,img2poems
11291,e quinci puoi argomentare ancora,vostra resurrezion se tu ripensi,come l'umana carne fessi allora,img2poems
11292,solea creder lo mondo in suo periclo,che la bella ciprigna il folle amore,raggiasse volta nel terzo epiciclo,img2poems
11293,per che non pur a lei faceano onore,di sacrificio e di votivo grido,le genti antiche ne l'antico errore,img2poems
11294,e da costei ond' io principio piglio,pigliavano il vocabol de la stella,che 'l sol vagheggia or da coppa or da ciglio,img2poems
11295,di fredda nube non disceser venti,o visibili o no tanto festini,che non paressero impediti e lenti,img2poems
11296,a chi avesse quei lumi divini,veduti a noi venir lasciando il giro,pria cominciato in li alti serafini,img2poems
11297,la mia letizia mi ti tien celato,che mi raggia dintorno e mi nasconde,quasi animal di sua seta fasciato,img2poems
11298,e quel corno d'ausonia che s'imborga,di bari e di gaeta e di catona,da ove tronto e verde in mare sgorga,img2poems
11299,e la bella trinacria che caliga,tra pachino e peloro sopra 'l golfo,che riceve da euro maggior briga,img2poems
11300,non per tifeo ma per nascente solfo,attesi avrebbe li suoi regi ancora,nati per me di carlo e di ridolfo,img2poems
11301,se mala segnoria che sempre accora,li popoli suggetti non avesse,mosso palermo a gridar: mora mora,img2poems
11302,la sua natura che di larga parca,discese avria mestier di tal milizia,che non curasse di mettere in arca,img2poems
11303,lo ben che tutto il regno che tu scandi,volge e contenta fa esser virtute,sua provedenza in questi corpi grandi,img2poems
11304,natura generata il suo cammino,simil farebbe sempre a' generanti,se non vincesse il proveder divino,img2poems
11305,ed ecco un altro di quelli splendori,ver' me si fece e 'l suo voler piacermi,significava nel chiarir di fori,img2poems
11306,onde la luce che m'era ancor nova,del suo profondo ond' ella pria cantava,seguette come a cui di ben far giova,img2poems
11307,ma lietamente a me medesma indulgo,la cagion di mia sorte e non mi noia,che parria forse forte al vostro vulgo,img2poems
11308,troppo sarebbe larga la bigoncia,che ricevesse il sangue ferrarese,e stanco chi 'l pesasse a oncia a oncia,img2poems
11309,qui si tacette e fecemi sembiante,che fosse ad altro volta per la rota,in che si mise com' era davante,img2poems
11310,dunque la voce tua che 'l ciel trastulla,sempre col canto di quei fuochi pii,che di sei ali facen la coculla,img2poems
11311,di quella valle fu' io litorano,tra ebro e macra che per cammin corto,parte lo genovese dal toscano,img2poems
11312,folco mi disse quella gente a cui,fu noto il nome mio e questo cielo,di me s'imprenta com' io fe' di lui,img2poems
11313,ma vaticano e l'altre parti elette,di roma che son state cimitero,a la milizia che pietro seguette,img2poems
11314,guardando nel suo figlio con l'amore,che l'uno e l'altro etternalmente spira,lo primo e ineffabile valore,img2poems
11315,leva dunque lettore a l'alte rote,meco la vista dritto a quella parte,dove l'un moto e l'altro si percuote,img2poems
11316,vedi come da indi si dirama,l'oblico cerchio che i pianeti porta,per sodisfare al mondo che li chiama,img2poems
11317,lo ministro maggior de la natura,che del valor del ciel lo mondo imprenta,e col suo lume il tempo ne misura,img2poems
11318,e io era con lui ma del salire,non m'accors' io se non com' uom s'accorge,anzi 'l primo pensier del suo venire,img2poems
11319,tal era quivi la quarta famiglia,de l'alto padre che sempre la sazia,mostrando come spira e come figlia,img2poems
11320,ne la corte del cielo ond' io rivegno,si trovan molte gioie care e belle,tanto che non si posson trar del regno,img2poems
11321,donne mi parver non da ballo sciolte,ma che s'arrestin tacite ascoltando,fin che le nove note hanno ricolte,img2poems
11322,multiplicato in te tanto resplende,che ti conduce su per quella scala,u' sanza risalir nessun discende,img2poems
11323,tu vuo' saper di quai piante s'infiora,questa ghirlanda che 'ntorno vagheggia,la bella donna ch'al ciel t'avvalora,img2poems
11324,io fui de li agni de la santa greggia,che domenico mena per cammino,u' ben s'impingua se non si vaneggia,img2poems
11325,l'altro ch'appresso addorna il nostro coro,quel pietro fu che con la poverella,offerse a santa chiesa suo tesoro,img2poems
11326,ne l'altra piccioletta luce ride,quello avvocato de' tempi cristiani,del cui latino augustin si provide,img2poems
11327,per vedere ogne ben dentro vi gode,l'anima santa che 'l mondo fallace,fa manifesto a chi di lei ben ode,img2poems
11328,lo corpo ond' ella fu cacciata giace,giuso in cieldauro ed essa da martiro,e da essilio venne a questa pace,img2poems
11329,o insensata cura de' mortali,quanto son difettivi silogismi,quei che ti fanno in basso batter l'ali,img2poems
11330,chi dietro a iura e chi ad amforismi,sen giva e chi seguendo sacerdozio,e chi regnar per forza o per sofismi,img2poems
11331,e chi rubare e chi civil negozio,chi nel diletto de la carne involto,s'affaticava e chi si dava a l'ozio,img2poems
11332,poi che ciascuno fu tornato ne lo,punto del cerchio in che avanti s'era,fermossi come a candellier candelo,img2poems
11333,intra tupino e l'acqua che discende,del colle eletto dal beato ubaldo,fertile costa d'alto monte pende,img2poems
11334,onde perugia sente freddo e caldo,da porta sole e di rietro le piange,per grave giogo nocera con gualdo,img2poems
11335,la lor concordia e i lor lieti sembianti,amore e maraviglia e dolce sguardo,facieno esser cagion di pensier santi,img2poems
11336,oh ignota ricchezza,oh ben ferace,scalzasi egidio scalzasi silvestro,img2poems
11337,poi che la gente poverella crebbe,dietro a costui la cui mirabil vita,meglio in gloria del ciel si canterebbe,img2poems
11338,di seconda corona redimita,fu per onorio da l'etterno spiro,la santa voglia d'esto archimandrita,img2poems
11339,e per trovare a conversione acerba,troppo la gente e per non stare indarno,redissi al frutto de l'italica erba,img2poems
11340,nel crudo sasso intra tevero e arno,da cristo prese l'ultimo sigillo,che le sue membra due anni portarno,img2poems
11341,e del suo grembo l'anima preclara,mover si volle tornando al suo regno,e al suo corpo non volle altra bara,img2poems
11342,pensa oramai qual fu colui che degno,collega fu a mantener la barca,di pietro in alto mar per dritto segno,img2poems
11343,e nel suo giro tutta non si volse,prima ch'un'altra di cerchio la chiuse,e moto a moto e canto a canto colse,img2poems
11344,canto che tanto vince nostre muse,nostre serene in quelle dolci tube,quanto primo splendor quel ch'e' refuse,img2poems
11345,come si volgon per tenera nube,due archi paralelli e concolori,quando iunone a sua ancella iube,img2poems
11346,nascendo di quel d'entro quel di fori,a guisa del parlar di quella vaga,ch'amor consunse come sol vapori,img2poems
11347,insieme a punto e a voler quetarsi,pur come li occhi ch'al piacer che i move,conviene insieme chiudere e levarsi,img2poems
11348,del cor de l'una de le luci nove,si mosse voce che l'ago a la stella,parer mi fece in volgermi al suo dove,img2poems
11349,quando lo 'mperador che sempre regna,provide a la milizia ch'era in forse,per sola grazia non per esser degna,img2poems
11350,in quella parte ove surge ad aprire,zefiro dolce le novelle fronde,di che si vede europa rivestire,img2poems
11351,non molto lungi al percuoter de l'onde,dietro a le quali per la lunga foga,lo sol talvolta ad ogne uom si nasconde,img2poems
11352,siede la fortunata calaroga,sotto la protezion del grande scudo,in che soggiace il leone e soggioga,img2poems
11353,dentro vi nacque l'amoroso drudo,de la fede cristiana il santo atleta,benigno a' suoi e a' nemici crudo,img2poems
11354,la donna che per lui l'assenso diede,vide nel sonno il mirabile frutto,ch'uscir dovea di lui e de le rede,img2poems
11355,oh padre suo veramente felice,oh madre sua veramente giovanna,se interpretata val come si dice,img2poems
11356,non dispensare o due o tre per sei,non la fortuna di prima vacante,non decimas quae sunt pauperum dei,img2poems
11357,poi con dottrina e con volere insieme,con l'officio appostolico si mosse,quasi torrente ch'alta vena preme,img2poems
11358,se tal fu l'una rota de la biga,in che la santa chiesa si difese,e vinse in campo la sua civil briga,img2poems
11359,ben dico chi cercasse a foglio a foglio,nostro volume ancor troveria carta,u' leggerebbe i' mi son quel ch'i' soglio,img2poems
11360,io son la vita di bonaventura,da bagnoregio che ne' grandi offici,sempre pospuosi la sinistra cura,img2poems
11361,illuminato e augustin son quici,che fuor de' primi scalzi poverelli,che nel capestro a dio si fero amici,img2poems
11362,ad inveggiar cotanto paladino,mi mosse l'infiammata cortesia,di fra tommaso e 'l discreto latino,img2poems
11363,imagini chi bene intender cupe,quel ch'i' or vidi e ritegna l'image,mentre ch'io dico come ferma rupe,img2poems
11364,quindici stelle che 'n diverse plage,lo ciel avvivan di tanto sereno,che soperchia de l'aere ogne compage,img2poems
11365,imagini la bocca di quel corno,che si comincia in punta de lo stelo,a cui la prima rota va dintorno,img2poems
11366,e l'un ne l'altro aver li raggi suoi,e amendue girarsi per maniera,che l'uno andasse al primo e l'altro al poi,img2poems
11367,ruppe il silenzio ne' concordi numi,poscia la luce in che mirabil vita,del poverel di dio narrata fumi,img2poems
11368,tu credi che nel petto onde la costa,si trasse per formar la bella guancia,il cui palato a tutto 'l mondo costa,img2poems
11369,e in quel che forato da la lancia,e prima e poscia tanto sodisfece,che d'ogne colpa vince la bilancia,img2poems
11370,quantunque a la natura umana lece,aver di lume tutto fosse infuso,da quel valor che l'uno e l'altro fece,img2poems
11371,per sua bontate il suo raggiare aduna,quasi specchiato in nove sussistenze,etternalmente rimanendosi una,img2poems
11372,e queste contingenze essere intendo,le cose generate che produce,con seme e sanza seme il ciel movendo,img2poems
11373,ond' elli avvien ch'un medesimo legno,secondo specie meglio e peggio frutta,e voi nascete con diverso ingegno,img2poems
11374,e se al surse drizzi li occhi chiari,vedrai aver solamente respetto,ai regi che son molti e ' buon son rari,img2poems
11375,ch'i' ho veduto tutto 'l verno prima,lo prun mostrarsi rigido e feroce,poscia portar la rosa in su la cima,img2poems
11376,non creda donna berta e ser martino,per vedere un furare altro offerere,vederli dentro al consiglio divino,img2poems
11377,quell' uno e due e tre che sempre vive,e regna sempre in tre e 'n due e 'n uno,non circunscritto e tutto circunscrive,img2poems
11378,tre volte era cantato da ciascuno,di quelli spirti con tal melodia,ch'ad ogne merto saria giusto muno,img2poems
11379,forse non pur per lor ma per le mamme,per li padri e per li altri che fuor cari,anzi che fosser sempiterne fiamme,img2poems
11380,ed ecco intorno di chiarezza pari,nascere un lustro sopra quel che v'era,per guisa d'orizzonte che rischiari,img2poems
11381,e non er' anco del mio petto essausto,l'ardor del sacrificio ch'io conobbi,esso litare stato accetto e fausto,img2poems
11382,di corno in corno e tra la cima e 'l basso,si movien lumi scintillando forte,nel congiugnersi insieme e nel trapasso,img2poems
11383,moversi per lo raggio onde si lista,talvolta l'ombra che per sua difesa,la gente con ingegno e arte acquista,img2poems
11384,forse la mia parola par troppo osa,posponendo il piacer de li occhi belli,ne' quai mirando mio disio ha posa,img2poems
11385,come saranno a' giusti preghi sorde,quelle sustanze che per darmi voglia,ch'io le pregassi a tacer fur concorde,img2poems
11386,e pare stella che tramuti loco,se non che da la parte ond' e' s'accende,nulla sen perde ed esso dura poco,img2poems
11387,io mi volsi a beatrice e quella udio,pria ch'io parlassi e arrisemi un cenno,che fece crescer l'ali al voler mio,img2poems
11388,mio figlio fu e tuo bisavol fue,ben si convien che la lunga fatica,tu li raccorci con l'opere tue,img2poems
11389,fiorenza dentro da la cerchia antica,ond' ella toglie ancora e terza e nona,si stava in pace sobria e pudica,img2poems
11390,non faceva nascendo ancor paura,la figlia al padre che 'l tempo e la dote,non fuggien quinci e quindi la misura,img2poems
11391,bellincion berti vid' io andar cinto,di cuoio e d'osso e venir da lo specchio,la donna sua sanza 'l viso dipinto,img2poems
11392,e vidi quel d'i nerli e quel del vecchio,esser contenti a la pelle scoperta,e le sue donne al fuso e al pennecchio,img2poems
11393,l'altra traendo a la rocca la chioma,favoleggiava con la sua famiglia,d'i troiani di fiesole e di roma,img2poems
11394,saria tenuta allor tal maraviglia,una cianghella un lapo salterello,qual or saria cincinnato e corniglia,img2poems
11395,moronto fu mio frate ed eliseo,mia donna venne a me di val di pado,e quindi il sopranome tuo si feo,img2poems
11396,poi seguitai lo 'mperador currado,ed el mi cinse de la sua milizia,tanto per bene ovrar li venni in grado,img2poems
11397,dietro li andai incontro a la nequizia,di quella legge il cui popolo usurpa,per colpa d'i pastor vostra giustizia,img2poems
11398,quivi fu' io da quella gente turpa,disviluppato dal mondo fallace,lo cui amor molt' anime deturpa,img2poems
11399,onde beatrice ch'era un poco scevra,ridendo parve quella che tossio,al primo fallo scritto di ginevra,img2poems
11400,al suo leon cinquecento cinquanta,e trenta fiate venne questo foco,a rinfiammarsi sotto la sua pianta,img2poems
11401,tutti color ch'a quel tempo eran ivi,da poter arme tra marte e 'l batista,eran il quinto di quei ch'or son vivi,img2poems
11402,oh quanto fora meglio esser vicine,quelle genti ch'io dico e al galluzzo,e a trespiano aver vostro confine,img2poems
11403,sariesi montemurlo ancor de' conti,sarieno i cerchi nel piovier d'acone,e forse in valdigrieve i buondelmonti,img2poems
11404,sempre la confusion de le persone,principio fu del mal de la cittade,come del vostro il cibo che s'appone,img2poems
11405,se tu riguardi luni e orbisaglia,come sono ite e come se ne vanno,di retro ad esse chiusi e sinigaglia,img2poems
11406,l'oltracotata schiatta che s'indraca,dietro a chi fugge e a chi mostra 'l dente,o ver la borsa com' agnel si placa,img2poems
11407,ciascun che de la bella insegna porta,del gran barone il cui nome e 'l cui pregio,la festa di tommaso riconforta,img2poems
11408,da esso ebbe milizia e privilegio,avvegna che con popol si rauni,oggi colui che la fascia col fregio,img2poems
11409,la casa di che nacque il vostro fleto,per lo giusto disdegno che v'ha morti,e puose fine al vostro viver lieto,img2poems
11410,ma conveniesi a quella pietra scema,che guarda 'l ponte che fiorenza fesse,vittima ne la sua pace postrema,img2poems
11411,tal era io e tal era sentito,e da beatrice e da la santa lampa,che pria per me avea mutato sito,img2poems
11412,mentre ch'io era a virgilio congiunto,su per lo monte che l'anime cura,e discendendo nel mondo defunto,img2poems
11413,dette mi fuor di mia vita futura,parole gravi avvegna ch'io mi senta,ben tetragono ai colpi di ventura,img2poems
11414,ma per chiare parole e con preciso,latin rispuose quello amor paterno,chiuso e parvente del suo proprio riso,img2poems
11415,qual si partio ipolito d'atene,per la spietata e perfida noverca,tal di fiorenza partir ti convene,img2poems
11416,a lui t'aspetta e a' suoi benefici,per lui fia trasmutata molta gente,cambiando condizion ricchi e mendici,img2poems
11417,io cominciai come colui che brama,dubitando consiglio da persona,che vede e vuol dirittamente e ama,img2poems
11418,e poscia per lo ciel di lume in lume,ho io appreso quel che s'io ridico,a molti fia sapor di forte agrume,img2poems
11419,e s'io al vero son timido amico,temo di perder viver tra coloro,che questo tempo chiameranno antico,img2poems
11420,io mi rivolsi a l'amoroso suono,del mio conforto e qual io allor vidi,ne li occhi santi amor qui l'abbandono,img2poems
11421,tanto poss' io di quel punto ridire,che rimirando lei lo mio affetto,libero fu da ogne altro disire,img2poems
11422,e al nome de l'alto macabeo,vidi moversi un altro roteando,e letizia era ferza del paleo,img2poems
11423,poscia trasse guiglielmo e rinoardo,e 'l duca gottifredi la mia vista,per quella croce e ruberto guiscardo,img2poems
11424,indi tra l'altre luci mota e mista,mostrommi l'alma che m'avea parlato,qual era tra i cantor del cielo artista,img2poems
11425,io mi rivolsi dal mio destro lato,per vedere in beatrice il mio dovere,o per parlare o per atto segnato,img2poems
11426,e vidi le sue luci tanto mere,tanto gioconde che la sua sembianza,vinceva li altri e l'ultimo solere,img2poems
11427,prima cantando a sua nota moviensi,poi diventando l'un di questi segni,un poco s'arrestavano e taciensi,img2poems
11428,poi come nel percuoter d'i ciocchi arsi,surgono innumerabili faville,onde li stolti sogliono agurarsi,img2poems
11429,o dolce stella quali e quante gemme,mi dimostraro che nostra giustizia,effetto sia del ciel che tu ingemme,img2poems
11430,per ch'io prego la mente in che s'inizia,tuo moto e tua virtute che rimiri,ond' esce il fummo che 'l tuo raggio vizia,img2poems
11431,ma tu che sol per cancellare scrivi,pensa che pietro e paulo che moriro,per la vigna che guasti ancor son vivi,img2poems
11432,parea dinanzi a me con l'ali aperte,la bella image che nel dolce frui,liete facevan l'anime conserte,img2poems
11433,solvetemi spirando il gran digiuno,che lungamente m'ha tenuto in fame,non trovandoli in terra cibo alcuno,img2poems
11434,ben so io che se 'n cielo altro reame,la divina giustizia fa suo specchio,che 'l vostro non l'apprende con velame,img2poems
11435,quasi falcone ch'esce del cappello,move la testa e con l'ali si plaude,voglia mostrando e faccendosi bello,img2poems
11436,dunque vostra veduta che convene,esser alcun de' raggi de la mente,di che tutte le cose son ripiene,img2poems
11437,e tutti suoi voleri e atti buoni,sono quanto ragione umana vede,sanza peccato in vita o in sermoni,img2poems
11438,or tu chi se' che vuo' sedere a scranna,per giudicar di lungi mille miglia,con la veduta corta d'una spanna,img2poems
11439,certo a colui che meco s'assottiglia,se la scrittura sovra voi non fosse,da dubitar sarebbe a maraviglia,img2poems
11440,ma vedi: molti gridan cristo cristo,che saranno in giudicio assai men prope,a lui che tal che non conosce cristo,img2poems
11441,che poran dir li perse a' vostri regi,come vedranno quel volume aperto,nel qual si scrivon tutti suoi dispregi,img2poems

11443,oh beata ungheria se non si lascia,e beata navarra,se s'armasse del monte che la fascia,img2poems
11444,e questo atto del ciel mi venne a mente,come 'l segno del mondo e de' suoi duci,nel benedetto rostro fu tacente,img2poems
11445,o dolce amor che di riso t'ammanti,quanto parevi ardente in que' flailli,ch'avieno spirto sol di pensier santi,img2poems
11446,poscia che i cari e lucidi lapilli,ond' io vidi ingemmato il sesto lume,puoser silenzio a li angelici squilli,img2poems
11447,fecesi voce quivi e quindi uscissi,per lo suo becco in forma di parole,quali aspettava il core ov' io le scrissi,img2poems
11448,e quel che vedi ne l'arco declivo,guiglielmo fu cui quella terra plora,che piagne carlo e federigo vivo,img2poems
11449,ora conosce come s'innamora,lo ciel del giusto rege e al sembiante,del suo fulgore il fa vedere ancora,img2poems
11450,quale allodetta che 'n aere si spazia,prima cantando e poi tace contenta,de l'ultima dolcezza che la sazia,img2poems
11451,d'i corpi suoi non uscir come credi,gentili ma cristiani in ferma fede,quel d'i passuri e quel d'i passi piedi,img2poems
11452,e credendo s'accese in tanto foco,di vero amor ch'a la morte seconda,fu degna di venire a questo gioco,img2poems
11453,se non si temperasse tanto splende,che 'l tuo mortal podere al suo fulgore,sarebbe fronda che trono scoscende,img2poems
11454,qual savesse qual era la pastura,del viso mio ne l'aspetto beato,quand' io mi trasmutai ad altra cura,img2poems
11455,conoscerebbe quanto m'era a grato,ubidire a la mia celeste scorta,contrapesando l'un con l'altro lato,img2poems
11456,dentro al cristallo che 'l vocabol porta,cerchiando il mondo del suo caro duce,sotto cui giacque ogne malizia morta,img2poems
11457,di color d'oro in che raggio traluce,vid' io uno scaleo eretto in suso,tanto che nol seguiva la mia luce,img2poems
11458,vidi anche per li gradi scender giuso,tanti splendor ch'io pensai ch'ogne lume,che par nel ciel quindi fosse diffuso,img2poems
11459,e come per lo natural costume,le pole insieme al cominciar del giorno,si movono a scaldar le fredde piume,img2poems
11460,ma quella ond' io aspetto il come e 'l quando,del dire e del tacer si sta ond' io,contra 'l disio fo ben ch'io non dimando,img2poems
11461,che pur con cibi di liquor d'ulivi,lievemente passava caldi e geli,contento ne' pensier contemplativi,img2poems
11462,in quel loco fu' io pietro damiano,e pietro peccator fu' ne la casa,di nostra donna in sul lito adriano,img2poems
11463,poca vita mortal m'era rimasa,quando fui chiesto e tratto a quel cappello,che pur di male in peggio si travasa,img2poems
11464,or voglion quinci e quindi chi rincalzi,li moderni pastori e chi li meni,tanto son gravi e chi di rietro li alzi,img2poems
11465,come t'avrebbe trasmutato il canto,e io ridendo mo pensar lo puoi,poscia che 'l grido t'ha mosso cotanto,img2poems
11466,ma rivolgiti omai inverso altrui,ch'assai illustri spiriti vedrai,se com' io dico l'aspetto redui,img2poems
11467,questi altri fuochi tutti contemplanti,uomini fuoro accesi di quel caldo,che fa nascere i fiori e ' frutti santi,img2poems
11468,le mura che solieno esser badia,fatte sono spelonche e le cocolle,sacca son piene di farina ria,img2poems
11469,tu non avresti in tanto tratto e messo,nel foco il dito in quant' io vidi 'l segno,che segue il tauro e fui dentro da esso,img2poems
11470,col viso ritornai per tutte quante,le sette spere e vidi questo globo,tal ch'io sorrisi del suo vil sembiante,img2poems
11471,e quel consiglio per migliore approbo,che l'ha per meno e chi ad altro pensa,chiamar si puote veramente probo,img2poems
11472,e tutti e sette mi si dimostraro,quanto son grandi e quanto son veloci,e come sono in distante riparo,img2poems
11473,l'aiuola che ci fa tanto feroci,volgendom' io con li etterni gemelli,tutta m'apparve da' colli a le foci,img2poems
11474,come l'augello intra l'amate fronde,posato al nido de' suoi dolci nati,la notte che le cose ci nasconde,img2poems
11475,previene il tempo in su aperta frasca,e con ardente affetto il sole aspetta,fiso guardando pur che l'alba nasca,img2poems
11476,vid' i' sopra migliaia di lucerne,un sol che tutte quante l'accendea,come fa 'l nostro le viste superne,img2poems
11477,e per la viva luce trasparea,la lucente sustanza tanto chiara,nel viso mio che non la sostenea,img2poems
11478,quand' io udi' questa proferta degna,di tanto grato che mai non si stingue,del libro che 'l preterito rassegna,img2poems
11479,per aiutarmi al millesmo del vero,non si verria cantando il santo riso,e quanto il santo aspetto facea mero,img2poems
11480,ma chi pensasse il ponderoso tema,e l'omero mortal che se ne carca,nol biasmerebbe se sott' esso trema,img2poems
11481,il nome del bel fior ch'io sempre invoco,e mane e sera tutto mi ristrinse,l'animo ad avvisar lo maggior foco,img2poems
11482,per entro il cielo scese una facella,formata in cerchio a guisa di corona,e cinsela e girossi intorno ad ella,img2poems
11483,e come fantolin che 'nver' la mamma,tende le braccia poi che 'l latte prese,per l'animo che 'nfin di fuor s'infiamma,img2poems
11484,se per grazia di dio questi preliba,di quel che cade de la vostra mensa,prima che morte tempo li prescriba,img2poems
11485,ponete mente a l'affezione immensa,e roratelo alquanto: voi bevete,sempre del fonte onde vien quel ch'ei pensa,img2poems
11486,tenta costui di punti lievi e gravi,come ti piace intorno de la fede,per la qual tu su per lo mare andavi,img2poems
11487,fede che e,ond' io levai la fronte,in quella luce onde spirava questo,img2poems
11488,che quell' opere fosser,quel medesmo,che vuol provarsi non altri il ti giura,img2poems
11489,e io rispondo: io credo in uno dio,solo ed etterno che tutto 'l ciel move,non moto con amore e con disio,img2poems
11490,come 'l segnor ch'ascolta quel che i piace,da indi abbraccia il servo gratulando,per la novella tosto ch'el si tace,img2poems
11491,vuol ch'io respiri a te che ti dilette,di lei ed emmi a grato che tu diche,quello che la speranza ti 'mpromette,img2poems
11492,e come surge e va ed entra in ballo,vergine lieta sol per fare onore,a la novizia non per alcun fallo,img2poems
11493,con le due stole nel beato chiostro,son le due luci sole che saliro,e questo apporterai nel mondo vostro,img2poems
11494,non fu latente la santa intenzione,de l'aguglia di cristo anzi m'accorsi,dove volea menar mia professione,img2poems
11495,con la predetta conoscenza viva,tratto m'hanno del mar de l'amor torto,e del diritto m'han posto a la riva,img2poems
11496,e come a lume acuto si disonna,per lo spirto visivo che ricorre,a lo splendor che va di gonna in gonna,img2poems
11497,onde mei che dinanzi vidi poi,e quasi stupefatto domandai,d'un quarto lume ch'io vidi tra noi,img2poems
11498,quindi onde mosse tua donna virgilio,quattromilia trecento e due volumi,di sol desiderai questo concilio,img2poems
11499,pria ch'i' scendessi a l'infernale ambascia,i s'appellava in terra il sommo bene,onde vien la letizia che mi fascia,img2poems
11500,oh gioia,oh ineffabile allegrezza,oh sanza brama sicura ricchezza,img2poems

11502,la provedenza che quivi comparte,vice e officio nel beato coro,silenzio posto avea da ogne parte,img2poems
11503,quelli ch'usurpa in terra il luogo mio,il luogo mio il luogo mio che vaca,ne la presenza del figliuol di dio,img2poems
11504,non fu nostra intenzion ch'a destra mano,d'i nostri successor parte sedesse,parte da l'altra del popol cristiano,img2poems
11505,del sangue nostro caorsini e guaschi,s'apparecchian di bere: o buon principio,a che vil fine convien che tu caschi,img2poems
11506,fede e innocenza son reperte,solo ne' parvoletti poi ciascuna,pria fugge che le guance sian coperte,img2poems
11507,poscia che 'ncontro a la vita presente,d'i miseri mortali aperse 'l vero,quella che 'mparadisa la mia mente,img2poems
11508,come in lo specchio fiamma di doppiero,vede colui che se n'alluma retro,prima che l'abbia in vista o in pensiero,img2poems
11509,e questo era d'un altro circumcinto,e quel dal terzo e 'l terzo poi dal quarto,dal quinto il quarto e poi dal sesto il quinto,img2poems
11510,onde se 'l mio disir dee aver fine,in questo miro e angelico templo,che solo amore e luce ha per confine,img2poems

11537,nel giallo de la rosa sempiterna,che si digrada e dilata e redole,odor di lode al sol che sempre verna,img2poems
11538,la cieca cupidigia che v'ammalia,simili fatti v'ha al fantolino,che muor per fame e caccia via la balia,img2poems
11539,in forma dunque di candida rosa,mi si mostrava la milizia santa,che nel suo sangue cristo fece sposa,img2poems

11544,di tante cose quant' i' ho vedute,dal tuo podere e da la tua bontate,riconosco la grazia e la virtute,img2poems
11545,vidi a lor giochi quivi e a lor canti,ridere una bellezza che letizia,era ne li occhi a tutti li altri santi,img2poems
11546,e s'io avessi in dir tanta divizia,quanta ad imaginar non ardirei,lo minimo tentar di sua delizia,img2poems

11549,bastavasi ne' secoli recenti,con l'innocenza per aver salute,solamente la fede d'i parenti,img2poems
11550,poi che le prime etadi fuor compiute,convenne ai maschi a l'innocenti penne,per circuncidere acquistar virtute,img2poems
11551,io vidi sopra lei tanta allegrezza,piover portata ne le menti sante,create a trasvolar per quella altezza,img2poems
11552,siede lungh' esso e lungo l'altro posa,quel duca sotto cui visse di manna,la gente ingrata mobile e retrosa,img2poems
11553,di contr' a pietro vedi sedere anna,tanto contenta di mirar sua figlia,che non move occhio per cantare osanna,img2poems
11554,e contro al maggior padre di famiglia,siede lucia che mosse la tua donna,quando chinavi a rovinar le ciglia,img2poems
11555,veramente ne forse tu t'arretri,movendo l'ali tue credendo oltrarti,orando grazia conven che s'impetri,img2poems
11556,or questi che da l'infima lacuna,de l'universo infin qui ha vedute,le vite spiritali ad una ad una,img2poems
11557,vinca tua guardia i movimenti umani,vedi beatrice con quanti beati,per li miei prieghi ti chiudon le mani,img2poems
11558,li occhi da dio diletti e venerati,fissi ne l'orator ne dimostraro,quanto i devoti prieghi le son grati,img2poems

11561,o somma luce che tanto ti levi,da' concetti mortali a la mia mente,ripresta un poco di quel che parevi,img2poems
11562,e fa la lingua mia tanto possente,ch'una favilla sol de la tua gloria,possa lasciare a la futura gente,img2poems
11563,io credo per l'acume ch'io soffersi,del vivo raggio ch'i' sarei smarrito,se li occhi miei da lui fossero aversi,img2poems
11564,oh abbondante grazia ond' io presunsi,ficcar lo viso per la luce etterna,tanto che la veduta vi consunsi,img2poems
11565,ma per la vista che s'avvalorava,in me guardando una sola parvenza,mutandom' io a me si travagliava,img2poems
11566,ne la profonda e chiara sussistenza,de l'alto lume parvermi tre giri,di tre colori e d'una contenenza,img2poems
11567,e l'un da l'altro come iri da iri,parea reflesso e 'l terzo parea foco,che quinci e quindi igualmente si spiri,img2poems
11568,o luce etterna che sola in te sidi,sola t'intendi e da te intelletta,e intendente te ami e arridi,img2poems

11622,it has been proved that this impostor lived since skinner and that,the same person wrote the interpretations of words by way of glossary,which are subjoined to most of the poems,img2poems
11623,so spake th' apostate angel though in pain,vaunting aloud but rackt with deep despare,and him thus answer'd soon his bold compeer,img2poems
11624,peor his other name when he entic'd,israel in sittim on their march from nile,to do him wanton rites which cost them woe,img2poems
11625,him follow'd rimmon whose delightful seat,was fair damascus on the fertil banks,of abbana and pharphar lucid streams,img2poems
11626,witness the streets of sodom and that night,in gibeah when hospitable dores,yielded thir matrons to prevent worse rape,img2poems
11627,thrice he assayd and thrice in spite of scorn,tears such as angels weep burst forth: at last,words interwove with sighs found out their way,img2poems
11628,my sentence is for open warr: of wiles,more unexpert i boast not: them let those,contrive who need or when they need not now,img2poems
11629,thus belial with words cloath'd in reasons garb,counsel'd ignoble ease and peaceful sloath,not peace: and after him thus mammon spake,img2poems
11630,if thence he scape into what ever world,or unknown region what remains him less,then unknown dangers and as hard escape,img2poems
11631,others with vast typhoean rage more fell,rend up both rocks and hills and ride the air,in whirlwind hell scarce holds the wilde uproar,img2poems
11632,satan was now at hand and from his seat,the monster moving onward came as fast,with horrid strides hell trembled as he strode,img2poems
11633,him god beholding from his prospect high,wherein past present future he beholds,thus to his onely son foreseeing spake,img2poems

11637,the stairs were then let down whether to dare,the fiend by easie ascent or aggravate,his sad exclusion from the dores of bliss,img2poems
11638,such wonder seis'd though after heaven seen,the spirit maligne but much more envy seis'd,at sight of all this world beheld so faire,img2poems

11640,me miserable,which way shall i flie,infinite wrauth and infinite despaire,img2poems
11641,so saying his proud step he scornful turn'd,but with sly circumspection and began,through wood through waste o're hil o're dale his roam,img2poems

11643,haile wedded love mysterious law true source,of human ofspring sole proprietie,in paradise of all things common else,img2poems
11644,back stept those two fair angels half amaz'd,so sudden to behold the grieslie king,yet thus unmovd with fear accost him soon,img2poems
11645,but come for thou be sure shalt give account,to him who sent us whose charge is to keep,this place inviolable and these from harm,img2poems
11646,he scarce had ended when those two approachd,and brief related whom they brought wher found,how busied in what form and posture coucht,img2poems
11647,thus hee in scorn,the warlike angel mov'd,disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd,img2poems

11653,they eat they drink and with refection sweet,are fill'd before th' all bounteous king who showrd,with copious hand rejoycing in thir joy,img2poems
11654,words which no eare ever to hear in heav'n,expected least of all from thee ingrate,in place thy self so high above thy peeres,img2poems
11655,so all ere day spring under conscious night,secret they finish'd and in order set,with silent circumspection unespi'd,img2poems
11656,so scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce,had ended when to right and left the front,divided and to either flank retir'd,img2poems
11657,this saw his hapless foes but stood obdur'd,and to rebellious fight rallied thir powers,insensate hope conceiving from despair,img2poems
11658,so spake the son and into terrour chang'd,his count'nance too severe to be beheld,and full of wrauth bent on his enemies,img2poems
11659,as thus he spake each bird and beast behold,approaching two and two these cowring low,with blandishment each bird stoop'd on his wing,img2poems
11660,thus i embold'nd spake and freedom us'd,permissive and acceptance found which gain'd,this answer from the gratious voice divine,img2poems

11665,to whom the virgin majestie of eve,as one who loves and some unkindness meets,with sweet austeer composure thus reply'd,img2poems
11666,but that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt,to god or thee because we have a foe,may tempt it i expected not to hear,img2poems
11667,his violence thou fearst not being such,as wee not capable of death or paine,can either not receave or can repell,img2poems
11668,nor thou his malice and false guile contemn,suttle he needs must be who could seduce,angels nor think superfluous others aid,img2poems
11669,why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel,when i am present and thy trial choose,with me best witness of thy vertue tri'd,img2poems
11670,let us not then suspect our happie state,left so imperfet by the maker wise,as not secure to single or combin'd,img2poems
11671,seek not temptation then which to avoide,were better and most likelie if from mee,thou sever not trial will come unsought,img2poems
11672,wouldst thou approve thy constancie approve,first thy obedience th' other who can know,not seeing thee attempted who attest,img2poems
11673,o much deceav'd much failing hapless eve,of thy presum'd return,event perverse,img2poems
11674,what may this mean,language of man pronounc't,by tongue of brute and human sense exprest,img2poems
11675,serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt,the vertue of that fruit in thee first prov'd,but say where grows the tree from hence how far,img2poems
11676,god therefore cannot hurt ye and be just,not just not god not feard then nor obeid,your feare it self of death removes the feare,img2poems
11677,that ye should be as gods since i as man,internal man is but proportion meet,i of brute human yee of human gods,img2poems
11678,what fear i then rather what know to feare,under this ignorance of good and evil,of god or death of law or penaltie,img2poems
11679,to him she hasted in her face excuse,came prologue and apologie to prompt,which with bland words at will she thus addrest,img2poems
11680,so said he and forbore not glance or toy,of amorous intent well understood,of eve whose eye darted contagious fire,img2poems
11681,let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve,the faith they owe when earnestly they seek,such proof conclude they then begin to faile,img2poems
11682,being as i am why didst not thou the head,command me absolutely not to go,going into such danger as thou saidst,img2poems
11683,to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelm'd,confessing soon yet not before her judge,bold or loquacious thus abasht repli'd,img2poems
11684,between thee and the woman i will put,enmitie and between thine and her seed,her seed shall bruise thy head thou bruise his heel,img2poems
11685,so sented the grim feature and upturn'd,his nostril wide into the murkie air,sagacious of his quarrey from so farr,img2poems
11686,then heav'n and earth renewd shall be made pure,to sanctitie that shall receive no staine,till then the curse pronounc't on both precedes,img2poems
11687,god made thee of choice his own and of his own,to serve him thy reward was of his grace,thy punishment then justly is at his will,img2poems
11688,o conscience into what abyss of fears,and horrors hast thou driv'n me out of which,i find no way from deep to deeper plung'd,img2poems
11689,o woods o fountains hillocks dales and bowrs,vvith other echo farr i taught your shades,to answer and resound farr other song,img2poems
11690,childless thou art childless remaine,so death shall be deceav'd his glut and with us two,be forc'd to satisfie his rav'nous maw,img2poems
11691,she ended heer or vehement despaire,broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts,had entertaind as di'd her cheeks with pale,img2poems
11692,but adam with such counsel nothing sway'd,to better hopes his more attentive minde,labouring had rais'd and thus to eve repli'd,img2poems
11693,adam by this from the cold sudden damp,recovering and his scatterd spirits returnd,to michael thus his humble words addressd,img2poems
11694,o teacher some great mischief hath befall'n,to that meek man who well had sacrific'd,is pietie thus and pure devotion paid,img2poems
11695,but is there yet no other way besides,these painful passages how we may come,to death and mix with our connatural dust,img2poems
11696,nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livst,live well how long or short permit to heav'n,and now prepare thee for another sight,img2poems
11697,o pittie and shame that they who to live well,enterd so faire should turn aside to tread,paths indirect or in the mid way faint,img2poems
11698,from mans effeminate slackness it begins,said th' angel who should better hold his place,by wisdome and superiour gifts receavd,img2poems
11699,how comes it thus,unfould celestial guide,and whether here the race of man will end,img2poems
11700,to teach thee that god attributes to place,no sanctitie if none be thither brought,by men who there frequent or therein dwell,img2poems
11701,and now the tops of hills as rocks appeer,with clamor thence the rapid currents drive,towards the retreating sea thir furious tyde,img2poems
11702,he ceas'd discerning adam with such joy,surcharg'd as had like grief bin dew'd in tears,without the vent of words which these he breathd,img2poems
11703,needs must the serpent now his capital bruise,expect with mortal paine: say where and when,thir fight what stroke shall bruise the victors heel,img2poems
11704,so spake th' archangel michael then paus'd,as at the worlds great period and our sire,replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd,img2poems
